[{"title": "Barack Obama", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "content": "Barack Hussein <b>Obama</b> II ( b\u0259-RAHK hoo-SAYN oh-BAH-m\u0259; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American president in U.S. history. <b>Obama</b> previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004, and as a civil rights lawyer and university lecturer. <b>Obama</b> was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a B.A. in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, <b>Obama</b> enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He also went into elective politics. <b>Obama</b> represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Joe <b>Biden</b> as his running mate. <b>Obama</b> was elected president, defeating Republican Party nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism. Obama's first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis and included a major stimulus package to guide the economy to recover from the Great Recession, a partial extension of George W. Bush's tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major U.S. military presence in Iraq. <b>Obama</b> also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He ordered the counterterrorism raid which killed Osama bin Laden and downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. <b>Obama</b> also ordered military involvement in Libya in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, <b>Obama</b> was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. In his second term, <b>Obama</b> took steps to combat climate change, signing a major international climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. <b>Obama</b> also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout Obama's presidency. <b>Obama</b> promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans, culminating in the Supreme Court's decision to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges. <b>Obama</b> left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C. His presidential library in Chicago began construction in 2021. Since leaving office, <b>Obama</b> has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in various American elections, such as his former vice president Joe <b>Biden</b> in his successful bid for president in 2020. Outside of politics, <b>Obama</b> has published three bestselling books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006), and A Promised Land (2020). Rankings by scholars and historians, in which he has been featured since 2010, place him in the middle to upper tier of American presidents. == Early life and career == <b>Obama</b> was born on August 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states. He was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942\u20131995), was born in Wichita, Kansas and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the US in 1850. In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century. Obama's father, Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr. (1934\u20131982), was a married Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo. His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship. The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before <b>Obama</b> was born.In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964. <b>Obama</b> Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971, before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when <b>Obama</b> was 21 years old. Recalling his early childhood, <b>Obama</b> said: \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me\u2014that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk\u2014barely registered in my mind.\" He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indonesian East\u2013West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965. After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet district of South Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng district of Central Jakarta. === Education === At the age of six, <b>Obama</b> and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he was registered in school as \"Barry\" and attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\".In 1971, <b>Obama</b> returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School\u2014a private college preparatory school\u2014with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In high school, <b>Obama</b> continued to use the nickname \"Barry\" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980. <b>Obama</b> lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. <b>Obama</b> chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.Of his years in Honolulu, <b>Obama</b> wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered \u2014 to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect \u2014 became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\" <b>Obama</b> has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind\". <b>Obama</b> was also a member of the \"Choom Gang\" (the slang term for smoking marijuana), a self-named group of friends who spent time together and smoked marijuana. ==== College and research jobs ==== After graduating from high school in 1979, <b>Obama</b> moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, <b>Obama</b> made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, <b>Obama</b> traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA. After graduating, <b>Obama</b> worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985. ==== Community organizer and Harvard Law School ==== Two years after graduating from Columbia, <b>Obama</b> moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a faith-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988. He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens. <b>Obama</b> also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute. In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time. Despite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, <b>Obama</b> enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts. He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990. Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father. <b>Obama</b> graduated from Harvard Law in 1991 with a Juris Doctor magna cum laude. ==== University of Chicago Law School ==== In 1991, <b>Obama</b> accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book. He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.From April to October 1992, <b>Obama</b> directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name <b>Obama</b> to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be. === Family and personal life === In a 2006 interview, <b>Obama</b> highlighted the diversity of his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.\" <b>Obama</b> has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living. Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham, until her death on November 2, 2008, two days before his election to the presidency. <b>Obama</b> also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011. In Dreams from My Father, <b>Obama</b> ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s. He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down. The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended. In June 1989, <b>Obama</b> met Michelle Robinson when he was employed Sidley Austin. Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date. They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children. The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001. The <b>Obama</b> daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School. The Obamas had two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy. In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female. Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator. In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president. In 2011, <b>Obama</b> invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team, and he is left-handed.In 2005, the <b>Obama</b> family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.4 million in 2022) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago. The purchase of an adjacent lot\u2014and sale of part of it to <b>Obama</b> by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko\u2014attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.In December 2007, Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.8 million in 2022). Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million\u2014up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005\u2014mostly from sales of his books. On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments. Per his 2012 financial disclosure, <b>Obama</b> may be worth as much as $10 million. === Religious views === <b>Obama</b> is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person ... I have ever known\", and \"a lonely witness for secular humanism.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" <b>Obama</b> explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\" In January 2008, <b>Obama</b> told Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\" On September 27, 2010, <b>Obama</b> released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying: I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't\u2014frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead\u2014being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me. <b>Obama</b> met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992. During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright's statements were criticized. Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the <b>Obama</b> family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.In 2016, he said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him \"of all the different people I've met along the way\", adding: \"I carry these around all the time. I'm not that superstitious, so it's not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times.\" The items, \"a whole bowl full\", include rosary beads given to him by Pope Francis, a figurine of the Hindu deity Hanuman, a Coptic cross from Ethiopia, a small Buddha statue given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa. == Legal career == === Civil rights attorney === He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.). This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. The case was settled out of court. From 1994 to 2002, <b>Obama</b> served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago\u2014which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project\u2014and of the Joyce Foundation. He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.

Once elected, <b>Obama</b> gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, <b>Obama</b> supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002. In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.In January 2003, <b>Obama</b> became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited <b>Obama</b> for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms. <b>Obama</b> resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate. === 2004 U.S. Senate campaign === In May 2002, <b>Obama</b> commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race.

Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq. On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, <b>Obama</b> addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally, and spoke out against the war. He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, <b>Obama</b> won in an unexpected landslide\u2014which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, <b>Obama</b> delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004. Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan. In the November 2004 general election, <b>Obama</b> won with 70 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a Senate candidate in Illinois history. He took 92 of the state's 102 counties, including several where Democrats traditionally do not do well. === U.S. Senate (2005\u20132008) === <b>Obama</b> was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005, becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar\u2013Obama, which expanded the Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons; and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.

The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic, as it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his \"House Divided\" speech in 1858. <b>Obama</b> emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system.Numerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to <b>Obama</b> and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process, but with <b>Obama</b> gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules. On June 2, 2008, <b>Obama</b> had received enough votes to clinch his nomination. After an initial hesitation to concede, on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. On August 23, 2008, <b>Obama</b> announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe <b>Biden</b> as his vice presidential running mate. <b>Obama</b> selected <b>Biden</b> from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine. At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support. <b>Obama</b> delivered his acceptance speech at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium to a crowd of about eighty-four thousand; the speech was viewed by over three million people worldwide. During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.

At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, <b>Obama</b> and Joe <b>Biden</b> were formally nominated by former President Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.On November 6, 2012, <b>Obama</b> won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president. With 51.1 percent of the popular vote, <b>Obama</b> became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice. <b>Obama</b> addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\" == Presidency (2009\u20132017) == === First 100 days === The inauguration of Barack <b>Obama</b> as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009.

She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three for the first time in American history.On March 11, 2009, <b>Obama</b> created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls. The council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett. <b>Obama</b> also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe <b>Biden</b> and Jarrett. The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994 Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden. In July 2009, <b>Obama</b> launched the Priority Enforcement Program, an immigration enforcement program that had been pioneered by George W. Bush, and the Secure Communities fingerprinting and immigration status data-sharing program.In a major space policy speech in April 2010, <b>Obama</b> announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding earth science projects, a new rocket type, research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station. On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, <b>Obama</b> signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control. He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006. On January 5, 2016, <b>Obama</b> announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers. In a 2016 editorial in The New York Times, <b>Obama</b> compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history. In 2011, <b>Obama</b> signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act. Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden, <b>Obama</b> condemned the leak as unpatriotic, but called for increased restrictions on the National Security Agency (NSA) to address violations of privacy. <b>Obama</b> continued and expanded surveillance programs set up by George W. Bush, while implementing some reforms. He supported legislation that would have limited the NSA's ability to collect phone records in bulk under a single program and supported bringing more transparency to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). ==== Racial issues ==== In his speeches as president, <b>Obama</b> did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.Following Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a \"postracial America\". However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as an intense racial animosity directed at Obama. The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the killing of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to <b>Obama</b> giving a speech in which he noted that \"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\" The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri sparked a wave of protests. These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people. Though <b>Obama</b> entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.Several incidents during Obama's presidency generated disapproval from the African-American community and with law enforcement, and <b>Obama</b> sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists, with mixed results. Some in law enforcement criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police. In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried \"a great deal\" about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001. ==== LGBT rights and same-sex marriage ==== On October 8, 2009, <b>Obama</b> signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. On October 30, 2009, <b>Obama</b> lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV. The lifting of the ban was celebrated by Immigration Equality. On December 22, 2010, <b>Obama</b> signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign to end the don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces. In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, <b>Obama</b> stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages. In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\" On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, <b>Obama</b> said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so. During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013, <b>Obama</b> became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address. In 2013, the <b>Obama</b> administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage) and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act). ==== Economic policy ==== On February 17, 2009, <b>Obama</b> signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion (equivalent to $1074 billion in 2022) economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession. The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. In March 2009, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public\u2013Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets. <b>Obama</b> intervened in the troubled automotive industry in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors (GM) and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company. In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, <b>Obama</b> called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment. He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers\", which temporarily boosted the economy.The Bush and <b>Obama</b> administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, <b>Obama</b> signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.The unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year. Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries. By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent, decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013. During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter. GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter. Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year. In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain\". Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth. The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1\u20132.1 million, while conceding that \"it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\" Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President <b>Obama</b> than it has anytime since the end of World War II. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, <b>Obama</b> announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion (equivalent to $1.2 trillion in 2022) Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before <b>Obama</b> signed it on December 17, 2010.In December 2013, <b>Obama</b> declared that growing income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics. <b>Obama</b> urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. ==== Environmental policy ==== On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. <b>Obama</b> visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by <b>Obama</b> and the federal government. Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, <b>Obama</b> ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.In July 2013, <b>Obama</b> expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions.\" On February 24, 2015, <b>Obama</b> vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline. It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.In December 2016, <b>Obama</b> permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act.Obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president. ==== Health care reform ==== <b>Obama</b> called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans. On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which <b>Obama</b> wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009. After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, <b>Obama</b> delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals. In March 2009, <b>Obama</b> lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House. On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill\u2014without a public option\u2014on a party-line vote of 60\u201339. On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, colloquially \"Obamacare\") passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. <b>Obama</b> signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.The ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014, subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income, providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level. The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5\u20134 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6\u20133 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State\", as the statute reads. === Foreign policy === In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe <b>Biden</b> and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \"reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration. <b>Obama</b> attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya. On March 19, <b>Obama</b> continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran. On June 4, 2009, <b>Obama</b> delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for \"A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace. On June 26, 2009, <b>Obama</b> condemned the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election.In 2011, <b>Obama</b> ordered a drone strike in Yemen which targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American imam suspected of being a leading Al-Qaeda organizer. al-Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be targeted and killed by a U.S. drone strike. The Department of Justice released a memo justifying al-Awlaki's death as a lawful act of war, while civil liberties advocates described it as a violation of al-Awlaki's constitutional right to due process. The killing led to significant controversy. His teenage son and young daughter, also Americans, were later killed in separate US military actions, although they were not targeted specifically. In March 2015, <b>Obama</b> declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia. In 2016, the <b>Obama</b> administration proposed a series of arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion. <b>Obama</b> halted the sale of guided munition technology to Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people. ==== War in Iraq ==== On February 27, 2009, <b>Obama</b> announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. The <b>Obama</b> administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces. On August 31, 2010, <b>Obama</b> announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over. On October 21, 2011, President <b>Obama</b> announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"In June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by ISIL, <b>Obama</b> sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing. In August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, <b>Obama</b> ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIL. By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots. In early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq increased to 4,400, and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield. ==== Afghanistan and Pakistan ==== In his election campaign, <b>Obama</b> called the war in Iraq a \"dangerous distraction\" and that emphasis should instead be put on the war in Afghanistan, the region he cites as being most likely where an attack against the United States could be launched again. Early in his presidency, <b>Obama</b> moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan\", an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\" He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war. On December 1, 2009, <b>Obama</b> announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article. In February 2013, <b>Obama</b> said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014. In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.Regarding neighboring Pakistan, <b>Obama</b> called its tribal border region the \"greatest threat\" to the security of Afghanistan and Americans, saying that he \"cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary.\" In the same speech, <b>Obama</b> claimed that the U.S. \"cannot succeed in Afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy.\" ===== Death of Osama bin Laden ===== Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad. CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President <b>Obama</b> in March 2011. Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, <b>Obama</b> rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs. The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse, which was buried at sea several hours later. Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square. Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. ==== Relations with Cuba ==== Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City. The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with <b>Obama</b> at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of d\u00e9tente. Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\" On July 1, 2015, President <b>Obama</b> announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana. The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively. <b>Obama</b> visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. ==== Israel ==== During the initial years of the <b>Obama</b> administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries. The <b>Obama</b> administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. In March 2010, <b>Obama</b> took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem. In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so. <b>Obama</b> supports the two-state solution to the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\" In 2014, <b>Obama</b> likened the Zionist movement to the civil rights movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples, explaining: \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\" <b>Obama</b> expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict. In 2015, <b>Obama</b> was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"On December 23, 2016, under the <b>Obama</b> Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass. Netanyahu strongly criticized the <b>Obama</b> administration's actions, and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017. On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342\u201380 to condemn the UN Resolution. In 2023 during the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war, <b>Obama</b> criticized Israel's actions and the support of the United States to it. ==== Libya ==== In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate. In response to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi\u2014who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi\u2014announced an immediate cessation of military activities.The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets. Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector. Some Representatives questioned whether <b>Obama</b> had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath. <b>Obama</b> later expressed regret for playing a leading role in the destabilization of Libya, calling the certain situation there \"a mess\". He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government's overthrow was the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency. ==== Syrian civil war ==== On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian civil war, <b>Obama</b> issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\" This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015. In 2012, <b>Obama</b> authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels. The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the <b>Obama</b> administration on the Assad government, <b>Obama</b> chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued. In 2014, <b>Obama</b> authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL. ==== Iran nuclear talks ==== On October 1, 2009, the <b>Obama</b> administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The \"Complex Modernization\" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. In November 2013, the <b>Obama</b> administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While <b>Obama</b> hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party. The <b>Obama</b> administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\" In order to advance the deal, the <b>Obama</b> administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency. On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, <b>Obama</b> started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House. ==== Russia ==== In March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third. <b>Obama</b> and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010. In December 2011, <b>Obama</b> instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays, but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.After Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said <b>Obama</b> had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West\", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last. == Cultural and political image == Obama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement. Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough\", <b>Obama</b> told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\" <b>Obama</b> acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\" Additionally, <b>Obama</b> has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator. During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, <b>Obama</b> delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses. === Job approval === According to the Gallup Organization, <b>Obama</b> began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41 percent in August 2010, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office. He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, and maintained 50\u201353 percent approval for about a month, until his approval numbers dropped back to the low 40s. By August 2011, Obama's approval rating stood at only 38 percent; similar results were found in three other polls in October. His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52 percent shortly after his second inauguration.Obama saw his approval rating drop to 39 percent in December 2013. In polling conducted before the 2014 midterm elections, Obama's disapproval rating reached its highest ever at 55 percent. His approval rating continued to lag throughout most of 2015 but began to reach the high 40s by the end of the year. According to Gallup, Obama's approval rating reached 50 percent in March 2016, a level unseen since May 2013. In polling conducted January 16\u201319, 2017, Obama's final approval rating was 59 percent, which placed him on par with George H. W. Bush and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose final Gallup ratings also measured in the high 50s.Obama has maintained relatively positive public perceptions after his presidency. In Gallup's retrospective approval polls of former presidents, <b>Obama</b> garnered a 63 percent approval rating in 2018 and again in 2023, ranking him the fourth most popular president since World War II. === Foreign perceptions === Polls showed strong support for <b>Obama</b> in other countries both before and during his presidency. In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, <b>Obama</b> was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful. In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, <b>Obama</b> was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.On October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that <b>Obama</b> had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\", which drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures. He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office. == Post-presidency (2017\u2013present) == Obama's presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of his successor, Donald Trump. The family moved to a house they rented in Kalorama, Washington, D.C. On March 2, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the Profile in Courage Award to <b>Obama</b> \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\" His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics. On September 7, <b>Obama</b> partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities. From October 31 to November 1, <b>Obama</b> hosted the inaugural summit of the <b>Obama</b> Foundation, which he intended to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.Barack and Michelle <b>Obama</b> signed a deal on May 22, 2018, to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas' newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. Higher Ground's first film, American Factory, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2020. On October 24, a pipe bomb addressed to <b>Obama</b> was intercepted by the Secret Service. It was one of several pipe-bombs that had been mailed out to Democratic lawmakers and officials. In 2019, Barack and Michelle <b>Obama</b> bought a home on Martha's Vineyard from Wyc Grousbeck. On October 29, <b>Obama</b> criticized \"wokeness\" and call-out culture at the <b>Obama</b> Foundation's annual summit.Obama was reluctant to make an endorsement in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries because he wanted to position himself to unify the party, regardless of the nominee. On April 14, 2020, <b>Obama</b> endorsed Biden, the presumptive nominee, for president in the presidential election, stating that he has \"all the qualities we need in a president right now.\" In May, <b>Obama</b> criticized President Trump for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling his response to the crisis \"an absolute chaotic disaster\", and stating that the consequences of the Trump presidency have been \"our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.\" On November 17, Obama's presidential memoir, A Promised Land, was released.In February 2021, <b>Obama</b> and musician Bruce Springsteen started a podcast called Renegades: Born in the USA where the two talk about \"their backgrounds, music and their 'enduring love of America.'\" Later that year, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix, in a venture with his and Michelle's Higher Ground to develop comedy projects. On March 4, 2022, <b>Obama</b> won an Audio Publishers Association (APA) Award in the best narration by the author category for the narration of his memoir A Promised Land. On April 5, <b>Obama</b> visited the White House for the first time since leaving office, in an event celebrating the 12th annual anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act. In June, it was announced that the Obamas and their podcast production company, Higher Ground, signed a multi-year deal with Audible. In September, <b>Obama</b> visited the White House to unveil his and Michelle's official White House portraits. Around the same time, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator for his narration in the Netflix documentary series Our Great National Parks.In 2022, <b>Obama</b> opposed expanding the Supreme Court beyond the present nine Justices.In March 2023, <b>Obama</b> traveled to Australia as a part of his speaking tour of the country. During the trip, <b>Obama</b> met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and visited Melbourne for the first time. <b>Obama</b> was reportedly paid more than $1 million for two speeches.In October 2023, during the Israel\u2013Hamas war, <b>Obama</b> warned Israel that its actions could \"harden Palestinian attitudes for generations\" and weaken international support for Israel; any military strategy that ignored the war's human costs \"could ultimately backfire.\" == Legacy == Historian Julian Zelizer credits <b>Obama</b> with \"a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals.\" Zelizer notes Obama's policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act. Zelizer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama's term, saying that the consensus among historians is that <b>Obama</b> \"turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder.\" Zelizer calls this the \"defining paradox of Obama's presidency\".The Brookings Institution noted that <b>Obama</b> passed \"only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)\u2014and a fragile one at that\u2014the legacy of Obama's presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions.\" David W. Wise noted that <b>Obama</b> fell short \"in areas many Progressives hold dear\", including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the Great Recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for Obamacare. Wise called Obama's legacy that of \"a disappointingly conventional president\".Obama's most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a \"skinny repeal\", have thus far failed. However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.Many commentators credit <b>Obama</b> with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the <b>Obama</b> administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term. In 2010, <b>Obama</b> signed into effect the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.In 2009, <b>Obama</b> signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States, and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.As president, <b>Obama</b> advanced LGBT rights. In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGB people; the law went into effect the following year. In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces. A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office.Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban. In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries. <b>Obama</b> left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody since Democratic President Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.Human Rights Watch (HRW) called Obama's human rights record \"mixed\", adding that \"he has often treated human rights as a secondary interest\u2014nice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed.\"Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating. He gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president. In Gallup's 2018 job approval poll for the past 10 U.S. presidents, he received a 63 percent approval rating. === Presidential library === The Barack <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center is Obama's planned presidential library.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American president in U.S. history. <b>Obama</b> previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004, and as a civil rights lawyer and university lecturer. <b>Obama</b> was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a B.A. in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, <b>Obama</b> enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He also went into elective politics. <b>Obama</b> represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Joe <b>Biden</b> as his running mate. <b>Obama</b> was elected president, defeating Republican Party nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism. Obama's first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis and included a major stimulus package to guide the economy to recover from the Great Recession, a partial extension of George W. Bush's tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major U.S. military presence in Iraq. <b>Obama</b> also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He ordered the counterterrorism raid which killed Osama bin Laden and downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. <b>Obama</b> also ordered military involvement in Libya in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, <b>Obama</b> was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. In his second term, <b>Obama</b> took steps to combat climate change, signing a major international climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. <b>Obama</b> also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout Obama's presidency. <b>Obama</b> promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans, culminating in the Supreme Court's decision to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges. <b>Obama</b> left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C. His presidential library in Chicago began construction in 2021.

Raised on the South Side of Chicago, <b>Obama</b> is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met her future husband. She subsequently worked in nonprofits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago. Later she served as, vice president for Community and External Affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992 and they have two daughters. <b>Obama</b> campaigned for her husband's presidential bid throughout 2007 and 2008, delivering a keynote address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She has subsequently delivered acclaimed speeches at the 2012, 2016, and 2020 conventions. As first lady, <b>Obama</b> served as a role model for women and worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She supported American designers and was considered a fashion icon. <b>Obama</b> was the first African-American woman to serve as first lady. After her husband's presidency, Obama's influence has remained high. In 2020, she topped Gallup's poll of the most admired woman in America for the third year running. == Family and education == === Early life and ancestry === Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935\u20131991), a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (b. July 30, 1937), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store. Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.The Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South. On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Lowcountry region. Her paternal great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina. He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area. Her grandfather Fraser Robinson, Jr., built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (n\u00e9e Johnson) returned to the Lowcountry from Chicago after retirement.Among her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Dosey Shields, born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia, near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Adolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).As was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father. Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama, after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Michelle Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago. Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio, in the 20th century.All four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the U.S. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up. Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots. Among her contemporary extended family is Rabbi Capers Funnye; born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her grandfather Robinson's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. Funnye converted to Judaism after college. He is a paternal first cousin once-removed.Robinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor. She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\". Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides. She played piano, learning from her great-aunt, who was a piano teacher. The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church. They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan. She and her 21-month-older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.Her father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound effect on her. Subsequently, she was determined to stay out of trouble and perform well in school. By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy). She attended Whitney Young High School, Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita. The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours. Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\". She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought. She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer. She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class. === Education and early career === Robinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981. She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985 after completing a 99-page senior thesis titled \"Princeton Educated Blacks and the Black Community\" under the supervision of Walter Wallace.Robinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\". She believed her brother's status as an alumnus \u2013 he graduated in 1983, before being hired as a basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University \u2013 may have helped her during the admission process, but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth. She has said she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college, and that she had never spent time on a college campus.The mother of a white roommate reportedly tried to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race. Robinson said being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\". There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked,\" she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"While at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group who supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after school tutoring for older children. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt it should be more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988. By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\". Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups. She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases. She is the third first lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush. She later said her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined. === Family life === Michelle's mother Marian Robinson, was a stay-at-home mother. Her father was Fraser C. Robinson III, who worked at the city's water purification plant. Robinson's father, Fraser, died from complications from his illness in March 1991. She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since. Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm, in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.Robinson met Barack <b>Obama</b> when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments). She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate. Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.Before meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career. The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing (1989). Barack <b>Obama</b> has said the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other, since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\". They married on October 3, 1992. After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001). The <b>Obama</b> family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996, and to the US Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for US President, Michelle <b>Obama</b> made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week \u2013 to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters. She once requested that her then-fianc\u00e9 meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move; Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors. The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack <b>Obama</b> wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\" Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.The Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school. As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment. In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School. In 2008, Michelle said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they did not intend to have any more children. The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House. Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved in to the White House to assist with child care. === Religion === Michelle <b>Obama</b> was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack <b>Obama</b> were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle <b>Obama</b> announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"The <b>Obama</b> family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle <b>Obama</b> encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better \u2013 no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues \u2013 they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\" == Career == Following law school, <b>Obama</b> became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law. She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an Assistant to the Mayor, and as Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development. In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies. She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood twelve years after she had left. <b>Obama</b> later said she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".In 1996, <b>Obama</b> served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the university's Community Service Center. In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for Community and External Affairs.She continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008, but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election. She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods, and investments and royalties from his books.Obama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE: THS), a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL\u2013CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007. She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.In 2021, the former first lady announced that she has been \"moving toward retirement\". Though she continues to be active in political campaigns, the former first lady has said she is reducing the amount of work to spend more time with her husband. == Barack <b>Obama</b> political campaigns == === Early campaigns === During an interview in 1996, Michelle <b>Obama</b> acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.Although she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. <b>Obama</b> opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way. === 2008 presidential campaign === At first, <b>Obama</b> had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters. She says she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run. About her role in her husband's presidential campaign she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\". During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.In May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, <b>Obama</b> reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign. Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement in which she traveled to political events only two days a week and rarely traveled overnight; by early February 2008 her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days. She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey. She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.During the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle <b>Obama</b> as an \"Angry Black Woman\" and some web sites attempted to promote this image. <b>Obama</b> said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"By the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces. Partly intended to help soften her public image, her appearance on The View was widely covered in the press.The presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses. Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about <b>Obama</b> family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote: I wince a bit when Michelle <b>Obama</b> chides her husband as a mere mortal \u2013 a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god ... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator <b>Obama</b> is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique? On the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister. She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream. <b>Obama</b> said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\" She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt \"proud of her country for the first time\". The first statement was seen as a gaffe. Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.On an October 6, 2008, broadcast, Larry King asked <b>Obama</b> if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was. The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign. On Fox News' America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air and the show was canceled. === 2012 presidential re-election campaign === <b>Obama</b> campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, <b>Obama</b> became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid. By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image. Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the <b>Obama</b> administration, noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House. An <b>Obama</b> senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\". The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the <b>Obama</b> campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity. <b>Obama</b> was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency. Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast said Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.Prior to the first debate of the election cycle, <b>Obama</b> expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills. He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney. Consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter had won the debate. After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first lady was found through a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.Obama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of The Guardian said the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%. Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between <b>Obama</b> and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election. But, as Michelle Cottle of Newsweek wrote, \"... nobody votes for first lady.\" == First Lady of the United States (2009\u20132017) == During her early months as First Lady, <b>Obama</b> visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens. She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.Obama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington. On June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle <b>Obama</b> was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service. Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker. In 2009, <b>Obama</b> was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of the year. In her memoir, Becoming, <b>Obama</b> describes her four primary initiatives as First Lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher, Let Girls Learn, and Joining Forces. Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle <b>Obama</b> included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education. <b>Obama</b> made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears. In April 2012, <b>Obama</b> and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV). The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates. <b>Obama</b> was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden. In November 2013, a Politico article by Michelle Cottle accusing <b>Obama</b> of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum. Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\" A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\" Supporters of <b>Obama</b> note that the first lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.In May 2014, <b>Obama</b> joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The first lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag. <b>Obama</b> writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\". Over the course of the <b>Obama</b> presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle <b>Obama</b> was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton. A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found <b>Obama</b> had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders. Another poll that month found that 71% of Americans believed <b>Obama</b> should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving. On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President <b>Obama</b> was asked if the first lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\" On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, <b>Obama</b> denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\". In the epilogue to Becoming, <b>Obama</b> writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\" recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\" === Let's Move! === Obama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. <b>Obama</b> extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings. In January 2010, <b>Obama</b> undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity. On February 9, 2010, the first lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack <b>Obama</b> created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.Michelle <b>Obama</b> said her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\" Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating. Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.Several Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts. In January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican Governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the first lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating. <b>Obama</b> had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic she sought to diminish by targeting children since Let's Move! was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\" In February, Senator Ted Cruz said he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife was First Lady. === LGBT rights === In the 2008 US presidential campaign, <b>Obama</b> boasted to gay Democratic groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said the US Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case and drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"After the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, <b>Obama</b> included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative. On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle <b>Obama</b> came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle <b>Obama</b> had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said Michelle <b>Obama</b> and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle said: This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that. At the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it ... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\" === Domestic travels === In May 2009, <b>Obama</b> delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that there was chemistry between <b>Obama</b> and the students.In August 2013, <b>Obama</b> attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese. Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the first lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".In March 2015, <b>Obama</b> traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches. After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers, including John Lewis, in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.In July 2015, <b>Obama</b> journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.In October 2015, <b>Obama</b> was joined by Jill <b>Biden</b> and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members. In December 2015, <b>Obama</b> traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier. === Foreign trips === On April 1, 2009, <b>Obama</b> met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. <b>Obama</b> embraced her before attending an event with world leaders. <b>Obama</b> praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.In April 2010, <b>Obama</b> traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation. In Mexico, <b>Obama</b> spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures. Referring to the underprivileged children, <b>Obama</b> argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places,\" citing herself and her husband as examples.Obama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Gra\u00e7a Machel. <b>Obama</b> was also involved with community events in the foreign countries. It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.In March 2014, <b>Obama</b> visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese president Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the visit and intent in <b>Obama</b> journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples.\"In January 2015, <b>Obama</b> traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so, though <b>Obama</b> was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs, even being praised in some corners. <b>Obama</b> was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter. In June 2015, <b>Obama</b> undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British prime minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother. In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar, and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students. During the Qatar trip, <b>Obama</b> had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, <b>Obama</b> had intended to visit an Amman school, which had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.In March 2016, <b>Obama</b> accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America. Later that month, the first couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina, meeting with Argentine president Mauricio Macri. === Midterm elections === <b>Obama</b> campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections, making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's. Though <b>Obama</b> indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign, speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak. She toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010. Aides reported that, though viewed as essential by the White House, she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes. After the elections, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates <b>Obama</b> had campaigned for won. The Los Angeles Times concluded that while <b>Obama</b> was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".Obama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President <b>Obama</b> to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular.\" In May 2014, <b>Obama</b> was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%. In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\". <b>Obama</b> appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections. Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity. <b>Obama</b> raised her profile in October, touring three states in four days. <b>Obama</b> called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\". === Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign === <b>Obama</b> endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton. On October 13, 2016, <b>Obama</b> heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire. A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments <b>Obama</b> made in regards to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election. === Public image and style === With the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, <b>Obama</b> became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\". In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of \"The Harvard 100\"; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth. In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list. She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.At the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage <b>Obama</b> would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African Americans. Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week, but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.Obama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady, as she was accepted as a role model. On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British prime minister Gordon Brown. Newsweek described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\" and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance. Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette. Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred. <b>Obama</b> has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style, and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum. Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\". In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14 million to a company. She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals. She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.Obama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue. Every first lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue, but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover. <b>Obama</b> later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz. In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, and the first person in 48 years. In 2013, during the 85th Academy Awards, she became the first first lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture which went to Argo).The media have been criticized for focusing more on the first lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions. She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families. In 2008, U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erb\u00e9 argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and said <b>Obama</b> was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style. For three straight years \u2013 2018, 2019, and 2020 \u2013 <b>Obama</b> topped the Gallup poll asking who is the \"most admired woman\" in the U.S.Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months. In 2020, the magazine decided to retroactively choose a historically deserving woman for each year in which a man had been named Person of the Year, reflecting the fact that a woman or women had been named Person of the Year only eleven times in the preceding hundred. As part of this review, Michelle <b>Obama</b> was named the Woman of the Year for 2008. == Subsequent activities == In May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, <b>Obama</b> rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches. In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, <b>Obama</b> called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks. In July, <b>Obama</b> honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards. In September, <b>Obama</b> delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House, appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education, and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston. During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, <b>Obama</b> cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups. In November, <b>Obama</b> discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the <b>Obama</b> Foundation Summit in Chicago, and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.In April 2018, <b>Obama</b> responded to speculation that she might be running for president by saying she has \"never had the passion for politics\" and that \"there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics.\"On January 2, 2021, <b>Obama</b> encouraged Georgia residents to vote in the state's runoff in the U.S. Senate election and to contact VoteRiders, a non-profit voter ID education organization, to make sure they have the necessary ID to vote. On January 20, 2021, <b>Obama</b> and her husband attended the inauguration of Joe Biden. Michelle <b>Obama</b> wore a matching plum coat, sweater, pants, and belt designed by Sergio Hudson to the inauguration.In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.On April 28, 2023, <b>Obama</b> along with actress Kate Capshaw, joined Bruce Springsteen on stage during his show in Barcelona where they provided backing vocals and tambourine on Springsteen's song \"Glory Days\". === Becoming, podcast and television === Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.

They were both delivered at University of Chicago Medical Center by their parents' friend and physician Anita Blanchard. Sasha was the youngest child to reside in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr. arrived as an infant in 1961. In 2014, Malia and Sasha were named two of \"The 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014\" by Time magazine. Before his inauguration, President <b>Obama</b> published an open letter to his daughters in Parade magazine, describing what he wants for them and every child in America: \"to grow up in a world with no limits on your dreams and no achievements beyond your reach, and to grow into compassionate, committed women who will help build that world\". While living in Chicago, the Obamas kept busy schedules, as the Associated Press reported: \"soccer, dance and drama for Malia, gymnastics and tap for Sasha, piano and tennis for both\". In July 2008, the family gave an interview to the television series Access Hollywood. <b>Obama</b> later said they regretted allowing the children to be included. Malia and Sasha both graduated from the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., the same school that Chelsea Clinton, Tricia Nixon Cox, Archibald Roosevelt and the grandchildren of Joe <b>Biden</b> (when he was Vice President) attended. The <b>Obama</b> girls began classes there on January 5, 2009; Malia graduated in 2016. Before the family moved to Washington in 2009, both girls attended the private University of Chicago Laboratory School.In his victory speech on the night of his election, President <b>Obama</b> repeated his promise to Sasha and Malia to get a puppy to take with them to the White House. The selection was slow because Malia is allergic to animal dander; the president subsequently said that the choice had been narrowed down to either a labradoodle or a Portuguese Water Dog, and that they hoped to find a shelter animal. On April 12, 2009, it was reported that the Obamas had adopted a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog given to them as a gift by Senator Ted Kennedy; Malia and Sasha named the dog Bo. The White House referred to Bo as the First Dog.

They met with Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia and the first elected female head of state in Africa. Then they went to Morocco, where they had a panel with Freida Pinto and Meryl Streep moderated by CNN's Isha Sesay in Marrakesh and delivered a substantive amount of money to aid 62 million girls lacking access to formal education. They proceeded to Spain where Michelle delivered a message about the initiative.In August 2016, Sasha began working at Nancy's, a seafood restaurant in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. In the fall of 2016, Malia went on an 83-day trip to Bolivia and Peru. In February 2017, Malia started an internship for Harvey Weinstein at The Weinstein Company film studio in New York City.

Research by a genealogy team at Ancestry.com, published in 2012, stated that <b>Obama</b> is likely descended from the African slave John Punch through his mother's Bunch line, with generations of African Americans who gradually \"married white\" and became landowners in colonial Virginia. The Bunches later moved to Tennessee; in 1834 a daughter moved to Kansas, where Obama's mother was born four generations later. === Ann Dunham (1942\u20131995) === Obama's mother was born Stanley Ann Dunham.

He was born in 1925. Payne served during World War II in the U.S. Army 89th Infantry Division. <b>Obama</b> has often described Payne's role in liberating the Ohrdruf forced labor camp. There was brief media attention when <b>Obama</b> mistakenly identified the camp as Auschwitz during the campaign. In 2009, Payne spoke about his war experience: Ohrdruf was in that string of towns going across, south of Gotha and Erfurt. Our division was the first one in there. When we arrived there were no German soldiers anywhere around that I knew about. There was no fighting against the Germans, no camp guards. The whole area was overrun by people from the camp dressed in the most pitiful rags, and most of them were in a bad state of starvation. Payne appeared in the visitor's gallery at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, when his great-nephew was nominated for President. He was the assistant director of the University of Chicago's Library. === Ralph Dunham (1916\u20132012) === Ralph Dunham was Stanley Dunham's older brother and Obama's great-uncle, he served in the U.S. Army as an assignment and personnel officer during World War II.

But her daughter Madelyn Dunham (Obama's maternal grandmother) \"would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose, which along with a pair of jet-black eyes, was offered as proof of Cherokee blood\". To date, no concrete evidence has surfaced of Cherokee heritage in the McCurry line. === Ruth Lucille Armour (1900\u20131926) === Obama's family said that his paternal great-grandmother, Ruth Dunham, died November 26, 1926, from ptomaine poisoning.

He served as a private in Company A, 145th Ohio Infantry during the American Civil War. He died July 17, 1895, and is buried in the Olathe Memorial Cemetery in Olathe, Kansas. === John Punch === According to Ancestry.com's research in 2012, using a combination of historical documents and yDNA analysis, genealogists found that John Punch, the first documented African slave in the Colony of Virginia, has been documented as likely an eleventh great-grandfather of <b>Obama</b> through his mother, Ann Dunham, and her Bunch ancestors. With intermarriage, there were eventually both white and African-American lines of descent from Punch; some Bunch descendants were classified as white by the early 18th century. Other Bunch descendants were considered free people of color. Ralph Bunche, American delegate to the United Nations, is thought by historian Paul Heinegg to have likely been an African-American descendant of the Bunch family via South Carolina and Detroit, Michigan. === Jonathan Singletary Dunham (1640\u20131724) === Jonathan Singletary Dunham, born in 1640 in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was one of Obama's maternal eighth great-grandfathers and is his earliest ancestor known to be born in North America. == Paternal relations == Obama's family in Kenya are members of the Jok'Obama, a clan belonging to the Luo people, the nation's second-largest ethnic group. Linguistically, Luo is one of the Nilotic languages. The <b>Obama</b> family is concentrated in the western Kenyan province of Nyanza. === Hussein Onyango <b>Obama</b> (c. 1895\u20131979) === Paternal grandfather to Barack Obama, he was born Onyango Obama. (One source gives 1870\u20131975 as his dates of birth and death, possibly based on his tombstone in his home village. Barack <b>Obama</b> relates finding in 1988 a British document, based on a 1928 ordinance, recording his grandfather as 35 years old. The date of the document was estimated to be about 1930, which would mean that his grandfather had been born c. 1895.) The Luo are given names related to the circumstances of their birth, and Onyango means \"born in the early morning\".Onyango was the fifth son of his mother, Nyaoke, who was the first of the five wives of his father, Obama. Barack <b>Obama</b> relates how his step-grandmother Granny Sarah (Sarah Onyango Obama) describes his grandfather: \"Even from the time that he was a boy, your grandfather Onyango was strange. It is said of him that he had ants up his anus, because he could not sit still.\" As a young man, Onyango learned to speak, read and write in English, the language of British colonial administration in Kenya. Onyango worked as a mission cook and as a local herbalist. He joined the King's African Rifles during World War I. In 1949, Onyango spent at least six months in Kamiti Prison. He was tried in a magistrates' court either on charges of sedition or being a member of a banned organization. Records do not survive; all such documentation was routinely destroyed after six years by the colonial administration. Onyango was then subject to torture due to suspicions that he was an associate of the Mau Mau rebels. In his memoir, <b>Obama</b> recounted family descriptions of his grandfather's shocking physical state when released from prison: \"When he returned to Alego he was very thin and dirty. He had difficulty walking, and his head was full of lice.\" For some time, he was too traumatized to speak about his experiences. His wife told his grandson Obama: \"From that day on, I saw that he was now an old man.\" Onyango was permanently scarred, suffering pain and requiring assistance in moving until his death. Although previously he had worked closely with the British, Onyango became bitterly anglophobic after his experiences in Kamiti Prison. According to his third wife, Sarah, Onyango had converted from tribal religion to Roman Catholicism early in life. When Seventh-day Adventist missionaries visited the Kendu Bay area many people were baptized into the church, including Onyango. When he later converted to Islam, he took the first name Hussein. She said that he passed on the name of Hussein to his children, but not the religion. Onyango is sometimes referred to as Mzee Hussein Onyango Obama. The word mzee (meaning \"elder\") is a Kenyan honorific. To this day the <b>Obama</b> family in Kenya is divided between Seventh-day Adventists and Muslims. === Habiba Akumu <b>Obama</b> (c. 1918\u20132006) === Also known as Akumu Nyanjoga and Sje. She was Barack Obama's paternal grandmother, and the second wife of Hussein Onyango Obama. She had three children with Onyango: daughters Sarah and Auma, and son Barack (Barack Obama's father). Her father was named Njango or Njoga, and she was born and raised in the Western Kenyan village of Karabondi.In his memoir Dreams from My Father, <b>Obama</b> wrote that Akumu was miserable in her marriage and abandoned Onyango <b>Obama</b> and her children with him. She subsequently married again and moved to Tanganyika, now Tanzania. Her name Akumu means \"mysterious birth\". Her mother conceived her after having given birth to another child and before resuming her menses. Akumu took the name Habiba upon her conversion to Islam in her second marriage, to Salmin Orinda, a Muslim from Wagwe, near Homa Hills, South Nyanza. A photograph of her holding her son, Barack Sr., on her lap is on the cover of her grandson's memoir. (See image at right margin.) === Sarah <b>Obama</b> (b. 1933) === Aunt of U.S. President <b>Obama</b> and elder sister of his father, daughter of Hussein Onyango and his second wife, Habiba Akumu Obama.

Educated in the US at the University of Hawai\u02bbi and Harvard University, he returned to Kenya, where he became an economist with the government. He served in the ministries of transportation and finance. <b>Obama</b> Sr. married three times, and he fathered a daughter and at least four sons in addition to Barack II. === Hawa Auma Hussein === Aunt of U.S. President <b>Obama</b> and younger sister of his father, born to Hussein Onyango and second wife Habiba Akumu Obama. === Sarah Onyango <b>Obama</b> (1922\u20132021) === Sarah Onyango <b>Obama</b> was the third wife of Obama's paternal grandfather. She was known for short as Sarah Obama; she was sometimes referred to as Sarah Ogwel, Sarah Hussein Obama, or Sarah Anyango Obama.

(She should not be confused with her stepdaughter of the same name, Sarah Obama, a daughter of Onyango's second wife Akumu.)Although she was not a blood relation, Barack <b>Obama</b> calls her \"Granny Sarah\". Sarah, who spoke Luo and only a few words of English, communicated with President <b>Obama</b> through an interpreter. On July 4, 2008, Sarah <b>Obama</b> attended the United States Independence Day celebrations in Nairobi, hosted by Michael Ranneberger, the US ambassador in Kenya.During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, she protested attempts to portray <b>Obama</b> as a foreigner to the United States or as a Muslim, saying that while Obama's grandfather had been a Muslim, \"In the world of today, children have different religions from their parents.\" Sarah <b>Obama</b> was \"a strong believer of the Islamic faith\", in her words.In November 2014, Sarah <b>Obama</b> received an award from the United Nations for the work of an education foundation that she headed, as a part of Women's Entrepreneurship Day. === Kezia <b>Obama</b> (1940\u20132021) === Kezia \"Grace\" <b>Obama</b> (also known as Kezia Aoko) was born c. 1940.

They had at least two children together: Abongo [Roy] and Auma; and also claimed Bernard and Abo <b>Obama</b> as sons by Barack Sr. She lived in Bracknell, Berkshire, England, until her death in 2021. On March 22, 2009, Kezia <b>Obama</b> made a guest appearance on the British television show Chris Moyles' Quiz Night. Her sister, Jane, is the 'Auntie Jane' mentioned at the very start of Dreams from My Father; she telephoned <b>Obama</b> in the US in 1982 to tell him that his father had been killed in a car accident in Kenya. She died on April 13, 2021. === Malik <b>Obama</b> === Barack Obama's half-brother, also known as Abongo or Roy, was born c. March 1958, the son of Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr. and his first wife, Kezia. Born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya, he earned a degree in accounting from the University of Nairobi. The half brothers met for the first time in 1985 when Barack flew from Chicago to Washington, D.C., to visit him. They were best men at each other's weddings. The American <b>Obama</b> brought his wife Michelle to Kenya three years later, and they met with Malik again while meeting many other relatives for the first time.Malik lives in the Obamas' ancestral home, Nyang'oma Kogelo, a village of several hundred people, preferring its slow pace to that of the city. He runs a small electronics shop a half-hour's drive outside of town. A frequent visitor to the US, and a consultant in Washington, D.C., for several months each year, Malik has dual citizenship in Kenya and the United States.During his brother's 2008 presidential campaign, Malik <b>Obama</b> was a spokesman for the extended <b>Obama</b> family in Kenya. He dealt with safety and privacy concerns arising from the increased attention from the press.Malik ran for governor of the Kenyan county of Siaya in 2013. His campaign slogan was \"Obama here, <b>Obama</b> there\" in reference to his half-brother who was serving his second term as the president of the United States. Malik garnered a meager 2,792 votes, about 140,000 votes behind the eventual winner. Prior to the 2016 United States presidential election, he stated that he supported Donald Trump, the candidate for the Republican Party. He attended the third presidential debate as one of Trump's guests. === Auma <b>Obama</b> === Barack Obama's half-sister, born c. 1960, to Kezia, his father's first wife. As of July 2008, she was a development worker in Kenya. She studied German at the University of Heidelberg from 1981 to 1987.

At the award ceremony, she received the bronze sculpture 'Der Griff nach den Sternen' (Reaching for the stars), solely made for the award, by artist Hannes Helmke. === Abo and Bernard <b>Obama</b> === Said to be Barack Obama's half-brothers, Abo, also known as Samson Obama, was born in 1968 and Bernard was born two years later in 1970 to Kezia Obama. In Dreams from My Father, <b>Obama</b> wrote that his <b>Obama</b> relatives doubt that Abo and Bernard are the biological sons of Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr. === Ruth (Baker) Ndesandjo === Born Ruth Beatrice Baker in the United States c. 1937, the daughter of Maurice Joseph Baker and Ida Baker of Newton, Massachusetts, who are of Lithuanian-Jewish descent. Ruth Baker was a 1954 graduate of Brookline High School in Brookline, Massachusetts, and a 1958 graduate of Simmons College in Boston with a degree in business. She was a suburban elementary school teacher when she met and began dating Barack Sr. in Cambridge in June 1964, a month before his return to Kenya in August 1964. She followed <b>Obama</b> Sr. back to Kenya five weeks later, and married him in Kenya in a civil ceremony on December 24, 1964. She later became a private kindergarten director in Kenya. She had two sons with Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr.: Mark and David. She and Barack Sr. separated in 1971 and divorced about 1973. Since she remarried when her sons were young, they took their stepfather's surname, Ndesandjo, as their own. Her third son, Joseph Ndesandjo, was born c. 1980 in her second marriage. === Mark Okoth <b>Obama</b> Ndesandjo === Barack Obama's half-brother, born c. 1965, son of Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr. and his third wife Ruth Baker. Mark Ndesandjo runs an Internet company called WorldNexus that advises Chinese corporations how best to reach international customers. Mark was educated in the US, graduating from Brown University; he studied physics at Stanford University, and received an MBA degree from Emory University. He has lived in Shenzhen, China, since 2002. Through his mother, he is Jewish. He is married to Liu Xuehua (also spelled Liu Zue Hua in some reports), a Chinese woman from Henan Province. He is an accomplished pianist and has performed in concert.In 2009, Mark Ndesandjo published a semi-autobiographical novel, Nairobi to Shenzhen: A Novel of Love in the East. He published a memoir in 2013, entitled, Cultures: My Odyssey of Self-Discovery. In it, he accused their father Barack Sr. of abuse. === David Ndesandjo (c. 1967\u2013c. 1987) === Barack Obama's half-brother (also known as David Opiyo Obama), son of Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr. and his third wife, Ruth Baker, an American. He died in a motorcycle accident several years after his father's death in a car accident. === George Hussein Onyango <b>Obama</b> === Youngest half-brother of Barack Obama, born c. May 1982, son of Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr. and Jael Otieno. (She has since moved to Atlanta, Georgia as a full-time resident.) George was six months old when his father died in an automobile accident, after which he was raised in Nairobi by his mother and a French stepfather. His mother took him to South Korea for two years while she was working there. Returning to Kenya, George <b>Obama</b> \"slept rough for several years\", until his aunt gave him a six-by-eight foot corrugated metal shack in the Nairobi slum of Huruma Flats.As of August 2008, George <b>Obama</b> was studying to become a mechanic. He received little attention until featured in an article in the Italian-language edition of Vanity Fair in August 2008 during the US presidential campaign. This portrayed him as living in poverty, shame, and obscurity. The article quoted George <b>Obama</b> as saying that he lived \"on less than a dollar a month\" and said that he \"does not mention his famous half-brother in conversation\" out of shame at his own poverty. In later interviews, George contradicted this account. In an interview with The Times, he \"said that he was furious at subsequent reports that he had been abandoned by the <b>Obama</b> family and that he was filled with shame about living in a slum\".He told The Times, \"Life in Huruma is good.\" George <b>Obama</b> said that he expects no favors, that he was supported by relatives, and that reports he lived on a dollar a month were \"all lies by people who don't want my brother to win\". He told The Telegraph that he was inspired by his half-brother. According to Time, George \"has repeatedly denied ... that he feels abandoned by Obama\". CNN quoted him as saying, \"I was brought up well. I live well even now. The magazines, they have exaggerated everything \u2013 I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges.\" George <b>Obama</b> and the British journalist Damien Lewis published George's story in a 2011 book called Homeland. George also appeared in the 2012 film, 2016: Obama's America, an anti-Obama documentary. === Omar Okech <b>Obama</b> === At times using a variation of the name of his father, Onyango Obama, Omar Okech <b>Obama</b> is a half-uncle of Barack Obama. Born on June 3, 1944, in Nyang'oma Kogelo, he is the eldest son of Onyango and his third wife, Sarah Obama. He moved to the United States in October 1963 when he was 17 years old as part of Kenya president Tom Mboya's Airlift Africa project, to send promising Kenyan students to the US for education, particularly undergraduate and graduate school. Once he arrived in the country, his half-brother, Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr., found him a place at a boys' school then known as Browne & Nichols, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He later dropped out of school and changed his name to O. Onyango Obama. He has operated a liquor store in Framingham, where he resided as of March 2011. Barack <b>Obama</b> lived with Onyango in the 1980s while a student at Harvard Law School in Cambridge.Omar Okech <b>Obama</b> was subject to a deportation order in 1989. After an unsuccessful appeal, he was given a new deportation order in 1992. He was arrested on August 24, 2011, for driving under the influence, or DUI, and was held in jail until September 9, 2011, on a federal immigration warrant. The Boston Herald reported in August 2011 that <b>Obama</b> had had a valid Social Security card \"for at least 19 years\". On November 30, 2012, the Board of Immigration Appeals remanded the immigration case to the Executive Office for Immigration Review for reconsideration of the original order of deportation, which was issued in 1986 and re-issued in 1992.An immigration judge ruled on January 30, 2013, that Onyango <b>Obama</b> would receive a deportation hearing. Onyango's attorneys said that his defense at the December 3, 2013, deportation hearing would be a reliance on the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, because Onyango had resided in the U.S. since before January 1, 1972, the cutoff date of the 1986 amnesty. At the hearing, Immigration Judge Leonard I. Shapiro ruled that Onyango was eligible for permanent residence and would receive a green card. === Zeituni Onyango (1952\u20132014) === Zeituni Onyango, half-aunt of Barack Obama, was born May 29, 1952, in Kenya. Onyango is referred to as \"Aunti Zeituni\" in Obama's memoir Dreams from My Father. She entered the US in 2000 on a temporary visa with her son who was going to school; she applied in 2002 for political asylum due to unrest in Kenya and ethnic conflict. This was denied in 2004, but she remained in the country illegally. Her presence was leaked to the media during Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. She was granted asylum in 2010. She died on April 7, 2014, from complications caused by cancer and respiratory problems. == Michelle Obama's extended family == Barack <b>Obama</b> has called his wife Michelle <b>Obama</b> \"the most quintessentially American woman I know\". Her family is of African-American heritage, descendants of Africans and Europeans of the colonial era and antebellum eras. Michelle Obama's family history traces from colonists and slavery in the South to Reconstruction to the Great Migration to northern cities, in her family's case, Cleveland and Chicago. Each of her four grandparents was multiracial. Some of Michelle's relatives still reside in South Carolina. Extended family from her mother's Shields ancestors also reside in Georgia and throughout the South. === Jim Robinson === Michelle's earliest known relative on her father's side is her great-great grandfather Jim Robinson, born in the 1850s, who was an American slave on the Friendfield Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina in the Low Country, where African Americans developed as the Gullah people and culture. The family believes that after the Civil War, he worked as a Friendfield sharecropper for the rest of his life. He is said to have been buried there in an unmarked grave.Jim married twice, first to a woman named Louiser, with whom he had two sons, Gabriel and Fraser, Michelle Obama's great-grandfather. A daughter was born to the family, but her name has not been discovered, and she is believed to have died as a child. His second marriage to Rose Ella Cohen produced six more children. Fraser had an arm amputated as a result of a boyhood injury. He worked as a shoemaker, a newspaper salesman, and in a lumber mill. Carrie Nelson, Gabriel Robinson's daughter, is the keeper of family lore and the oldest living Robinson at 80 years old in 2008.At least three of Michelle Obama's great-uncles served in the military of the United States. One aunt moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where she worked as a maid. She cooked Southern-style meals for Michelle and her brother Craig, when they were students at Princeton University. === Melvinia Shields (1844\u20131938) === The earliest known relative on her mother's side is her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields (1844\u20131938), who was held as a slave on a farm in Clayton County, North Georgia. Her master was Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm near Rex. He would have worked along with his slaves. Melvinia became pregnant at about age 15 and had a biracial son, Dolphus T. Shields, born into slavery about 1860. Melvinia did not talk to relatives about his father. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said the father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. After the Civil War, Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama. Charles later became a teacher and married a white woman. Michelle Obama's extended family has said that people didn't talk about slavery time while they were growing up. Michelle Obama's distant ancestry also includes Irish and other European roots.On June 26, 2012, a monument to Shields was erected in Rex, with an inscription summarizing her life and \"a five-generation journey that began in oppression\" resulting in her descendant becoming First Lady of the United States. A year later, the monument was vandalized and knocked from its base, but was quickly replaced. === Marian Lois Robinson === Marian Lois Robinson (born Marian Lois Shields, July 30, 1937), is descended from Dolphus Shields and his wife. She is now widowed, but had married Michelle's father, Fraser Robinson, on October 27, 1960. Robinson was formerly a secretary at Spiegel catalog and a bank. While Michelle and Barack <b>Obama</b> were campaigning in 2008, Robinson tended the Obamas' young children. She continued to help care for them while living in the White House as part of the First Family; she was the first live-in grandmother since Elivera M. Doud during the Eisenhower administration. Some media outlets dubbed Robinson as the \"First Granny\". Marian took Sasha and Malia to school daily. === Fraser C. Robinson III (1935\u20131991) === Michelle Obama's father, born August 1, 1935, died March 6, 1991, married Michelle's mother, Marian Shields, on October 27, 1960. Robinson was a pump worker at the City of Chicago water plant. === Craig Robinson === Craig Robinson, Michelle Obama's brother, was born in 1962. From 2008 until 2014, he served as head coach of men's basketball at Oregon State University. === Fraser Robinson Jr. (1912\u20131996) === Michelle Obama's paternal grandfather was born on August 24, 1912, in Georgetown, South Carolina, and died on November 9, 1996, aged 84. He was a good student and orator but moved from South Carolina to Chicago during the Great Migration to find better work and living conditions than in the South, where Jim Crow had been imposed and blacks were disfranchised. He became a worker for the United States Postal Service. He married LaVaughn Johnson. When he retired, they moved back to South Carolina. === LaVaughn Dolores Johnson (1915\u20132002) === Michelle Obama's paternal grandmother (February 6, 1915 \u2013 September 17, 2002) and married to Fraser Robinson Jr. She was born in Chicago, Illinois, to James Preston Johnson (1880\u20131920?) and Phoebe (1879\u20131920?). === Robbie Shields Terry (1908\u20131983) === Robbie Shields Terry (born Robbie Lee Shields; July 3, 1908 \u2013 June 1, 1983) was Michelle Obama's great-aunt: her mother's father's sister. In the 1940 census, she was listed as head of household, with Marian Shields listed as niece. Michelle Obama, in her memoir, Becoming, introduces Robbie and her husband, Terry, in the first chapter. Her nuclear family moved into a small apartment on the second floor in their house while she was still a young child. Robbie was Michelle's piano teacher as well as nearest neighbor. When she died, Robbie, a widow, left the house to her mother, Marian, and father, Fraser Robinson, who moved downstairs. Subsequently, Michelle moved into the second floor apartment while working at the law firm Sidley & Austin. When Barack <b>Obama</b> settled in Chicago after graduating law school, he moved into this same apartment. === Capers Funnye === Capers C. Funnye Jr. is Michelle Obama's first cousin once removed: his mother, Verdelle Robinson Funnye (born Verdelle Robinson; August 22, 1930 \u2013 April 16, 2000), was a sister of Michelle Obama's paternal grandfather, Fraser Robinson Jr. He is 12 years older, and Funnye and <b>Obama</b> grew to know each other as adults in Chicago, where both were involved in community organizing, along with Barack Obama. He is one of America's most prominent African-American rabbis, known for acting as a bridge between mainstream Jewry and African American Jews. He converted to Judaism after 1970, during years of activism when he regarded Christianity as having been imposed on slaves. == Index == Key: Underscored: Now or once a member of Barack Obama's household Personal name bolded: Living Note: Every link in this index is to entries in this article === By last name === === By first name === == See also == Family of Joe <b>Biden</b> List of African-American firsts New England Historic Genealogical Society == References == == External links == \"The Mystery of Michelle Obama's Roots\" (Real Clear Politics) \"Fashionable first daughters, Malia and Sasha\" Archived July 21, 2009, at the Wayback Machine (New York Daily News news photos) Barack Obama's Family Tree \u2013 Photo Essays \u2013 Time \"Though <b>Obama</b> Had to Leave to Find Himself, It Is Hawaii That Made His Rise Possible\", by David Maraniss Barack Obama's Branch-y Family Tree by Jake Tapper \"Obama Family Tree\" series, by Scott Fornek \"Notes on the Ancestry of Senator Barack Hussein <b>Obama</b> Jr.\", by Gary Boyd Roberts \"Obama, Clinton and McCain have some famous relations\", by Associated Press \"Tracking Michelle Obama's Slave Roots\", by Joe Johns and Justine Redman Satirical Onion article about <b>Obama</b> son misinterpreted as fact Malia <b>Obama</b> collected news and commentary at The New York Times Sasha <b>Obama</b> collected news and commentary at The New York Times \"President Barack Obama's Roots\" by Megan Smolenyak \"Michelle Obama's Roots\" by Megan Smolenyak \"Obama's Irish family links by RT\u00c9", "summary": "The family of Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States, is a prominent American family active in law, education, activism and politics. Obama's immediate family circle was the first family of the United States from 2009 to 2017, and are the first such family of African-American descent. His immediate family includes his wife Michelle <b>Obama</b> and daughters Malia and Sasha. Obama's wider ancestry is made up of people of Kenyan (Luo), African-American, and Old Stock American (including originally English, Scots-Irish, Welsh, German, and Swiss) ancestry.", "Words": ["Obama", "Biden"]}, {"title": "Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_religion_conspiracy_theories", "content": "Allegations that Barack <b>Obama</b> secretly practices Islam, or that he is the antichrist of Christian eschatology, or covertly holds some other esoteric religious position, have been suggested since he campaigned for the U.S. Senate in 2004 and proliferated after his election as President of the United States in 2008. As with conspiracy theories surrounding his citizenship status, the claims are promoted by various political opponents, with American bloggers and conservative talk radio hosts particularly promoting the theories. Belief in these claims in the public sphere endured and, in some cases, even expanded during Obama's presidency according to the Pew Research Center, with 17% of Americans (including one third of conservative Republicans) believing him to be a Muslim in a 2012 poll.Obama practices Protestant Christianity. He attended Black churches while in his twenties. From 1992 until 2008, he was a member of the Trinity United Church of Christ\u2014a Reformed denomination. <b>Obama</b> left it in the wake of the Jeremiah Wright controversy. Since then, he has attended various Protestant churches, including Baptist, Methodist, and Episcopalian churches. == Background == In the political culture of the United States, mythologies of nativism and the immigrant identity of many citizens have often been in tension. The constitution contains a natural-born-citizen clause stating that any person born subsequent to the founding of the United States must be a \"natural born Citizen\" to be eligible to hold the office of president. As a result of the absence of a clear definition of a \"natural born Citizen\", a history developed of claims against presidents and presidential candidates asserting that citizenship of other nations held in addition to US citizenship, or aspects of ethnicity or religion, made them constitutionally unqualified to hold the office. Anti-Semitic pamphleteer Robert Edward Edmondson published Roosevelt's Jewish Ancestry\u2014\"He Is Not One Of Us!\" in 1939 in support of existing propaganda concerning president Franklin D. Roosevelt's religion and heritage and Roy Zachary, a leader of the Silver Legion of America, linked Roosevelt to the Crypto-Judaism of sixteenth-century Spain in public speeches.Nazi German caricatures of Roosevelt also depicted him as Jewish. In the twenty-first century, similar approaches were developed for Barack <b>Obama</b> and Islam. == Claims that <b>Obama</b> secretly practices Islam == According to the Los Angeles Times, false rumors saying that <b>Obama</b> was secretly a Muslim started during his campaign for the United States Senate in 2004 and had expanded through viral e-mails by 2006. The Times compared these rumors to earlier false rumors about 2000 presidential candidate John McCain fathering a mixed race child out of wedlock. The rumors were subsequently promoted by conservative talk show hosts, including Michael Savage.In December 2007 the Hillary Clinton campaign asked a volunteer county coordinator to step down after she forwarded an e-mail message which repeated the false rumor that <b>Obama</b> was Muslim. In June 2008, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, himself Jewish, spoke out to Jewish voters in Florida against false e-mail rumors which said that <b>Obama</b> was secretly a Muslim and did not support Israel. Bloomberg said: \"I hope all of you will join me throughout this campaign in strongly speaking out against this fear mongering, no matter who you'll be voting for.\"In 2015, Taha al-Lahibi, a former member of the Iraqi parliament known for promoting fringe conspiracy theories, claimed that <b>Obama</b> was \"the son of a Shiite Kenyan father.\" These unfounded claims do not have broad support among Iraqis, and al-Lahibi's claim prompted mockery.Obama was baptized into the United Church of Christ (UCC) denomination and formally joined it in 1988. He left the UCC in 2008 because of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy. He later worshiped with a Southern Baptist pastor at Camp David but has not become a formal member of any church since 2008.Though according to his own profession and some others, <b>Obama</b> is a practicing Christian and was chiefly raised by his mother and her Christian parents. His father, Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr., with whom he lived only as a baby, was characterized by <b>Obama</b> as being a Muslim-raised atheist. Also, his stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, with whom he lived during his early childhood, was nominally Muslim. This familial connection to Islam, among other things, is a basis of claims that <b>Obama</b> secretly practices Islam. === Qur'an claim === A chain e-mail circulating during the presidential campaign claimed that <b>Obama</b> took his oath of office as a U.S. Senator in 2005 while placing his hand on a Qur'an rather than a Bible. This claim is false, as <b>Obama</b> was sworn into office using a Bible that he owned. The claim may have been inspired by a photo-op re-enactment of the 2007 swearing-in of U.S. Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who used a Qur'an that had belonged to Thomas Jefferson. === Madrasa claim === An early version of a rumor that <b>Obama</b> had \"spent at least four years in a so-called madrasa, or Muslim seminary, in Indonesia\" appeared in an article published by Insight on the News, a magazine published by News World Communications, an international media conglomerate then owned by the Unification Church. Insight on the News ceased publication soon after the incident. Its editor, Jeff Kuhner, claimed that a person working for the Clinton campaign had told him that the campaign was \"preparing an accusation that her rival Senator Barack <b>Obama</b> had covered up a brief period he had spent in an Islamic religious school in Indonesia when he was six\". Senator Clinton denied the allegations. When interviewed by The New York Times, Kuhner did not name the person said to be his reporter's source.Obama attended two schools during the four years he lived in Indonesia as a child (1967\u20131971). From the first grade until some time in the third grade he attended the Roman Catholic St. Francis Assisi School, where classes began and ended each day with Christian prayers. He was registered there as Muslim because of his stepfather's nominal religion. At some point during the third grade he transferred to State Elementary School Menteng 01, also known as Besuki School, for less than a year. Besuki is a secular public school. Students there wear Western clothing, and the Chicago Tribune described the school as \"so progressive that teachers wore miniskirts and all students were encouraged to celebrate Christmas\".Soon after Insight's story, CNN reporter John Vause visited State Elementary School Menteng 01 and found that each student received two hours of religious instruction per week in their own faith. Hardi Priyono, the deputy headmaster of the school told Vause: \"This is a public school. We don't focus on religion. In our daily lives, we try to respect religion, but we don't give preferential treatment.\"Interviews by Nedra Pickler of the Associated Press found that students of all faiths have been welcome there since before Obama's attendance. Akmad Solichin, the vice-principal of the school, told Pickler: \"The allegations are completely baseless. Yes, most of our students are Muslim, but there are Christians as well. Everyone's welcome here ... it's a public school.\" === Middle name \"Mohammed\" claim === One chain e-mail claimed incorrectly that President Obama's middle name is Mohammed or Muhammed. His actual middle name is Hussein inherited from his father. === \"My Muslim faith\" gaffe === During an interview with ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos two months before the 2008 presidential election, <b>Obama</b> said: What I was suggesting \u2014 you're absolutely right that John McCain has not talked about my Muslim faith. Fact-checking website Snopes rated the claim that \"Barack <b>Obama</b> admitted to being a Muslim during an ABC News interview\" as \"false\". === Polls and surveys === Public opinion surveys carried out, beginning in 2008, have shown that a number of Americans believe that <b>Obama</b> is a Muslim. In March 2008, a survey conducted by Pew Research Center found that 10% of respondents believed that rumor. Those who were more likely to believe he is a Muslim included political conservatives (both Republicans and Democrats), people who had not attended college, people who lived in the Midwest or the South, and people in rural areas.A study conducted by the University of Georgia found that the percentage of Americans who believed that <b>Obama</b> is a Muslim remained constant at approximately 20% in September, October, and November 2008, despite frequent attempts by the media as well as the <b>Obama</b> campaign to correct this misconception. However, the study also showed that some people who had initially believed <b>Obama</b> to be a Christian later believed the rumor that he is a Muslim. The survey found that respondents who had shifted to the misconception were generally younger, less politically involved, less educated, more conservative, and more likely to believe in Biblical literalism. According to Professor Barry Hollander, \"These are groups of people who are generally distrustful of the mainstream media...So therefore journalists telling them that this is not true could actually have the opposite effect and make them more likely to believe the rumor.\"In August 2010, a Pew Research poll showed that 18% of Americans and 30% of Republicans believed that <b>Obama</b> is a Muslim.In 2012, data from the Pew Center found that the popularity of the misinformation had increased in some groups. Specifically, over one in seven Americans (including one third of conservative Republicans) labeled the President a Muslim. Haris Tarin of the Muslim Public Affairs Council said that the survey \"shows there's a lot of fear-mongering and politicking in America\".A 2016 Public Policy Polling survey indicated that 65% of Trump supporters believed that <b>Obama</b> was Muslim, and only 13% believed he was Christian. == Obama's response == I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't\u2014frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead\u2014being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me. And I think also understanding that Jesus Christ dying for my sins spoke to the humility we all have to have as human beings, that we're sinful and we're flawed and we make mistakes, and that we achieve salvation through the grace of God. But what we can do, as flawed as we are, is still see God in other people and do our best to help them find their own grace. That's what I strive to do. That's what I pray to do every day. I think my public service is part of that effort to express my Christian faith. === In person === <b>Obama</b> has publicly responded to questions regarding his religion on more than one occasion. During a debate of Democratic presidential candidates on January 15, 2008, in Las Vegas, Nevada, the moderator, Brian Williams, asked <b>Obama</b> about the rumor that he was \"trying to hide the fact that he is a Muslim\". <b>Obama</b> responded that \"the facts are: I am a Christian. I have been sworn in [to the US Senate] with a Bible.\" He then said \"in the Internet age, there are going to be lies that are spread all over the place. I have been victimized by these lies.\"On June 4, 2009, <b>Obama</b> delivered a speech at Cairo University titled \"A New Beginning\". The entire speech was recorded by C-SPAN. During his speech to the largely Muslim audience, <b>Obama</b> declared, \"I'm a Christian.\"In an interview with NBC journalist Brian Williams on August 29, 2010, Williams asked <b>Obama</b> about a poll that said that 20% of the American public do not believe that he is a Christian or American born. <b>Obama</b> gave a similar answer to the one he gave in the January 2008 debate. During the 2011 National Prayer Breakfast, the President stated, \"My Christian faith then has been a sustaining force for me over these last few years, all the more so when Michelle and I hear our faith questioned from time to time\". === Institutional === In addition to Obama's personal responses, the 2008 <b>Obama</b> presidential campaign responded to the false claims made against him by people opposed to his candidacy by launching a website called \"FightTheSmears.com\". One of the false claims countered by the website is that he is a Muslim and not a Christian.In October 2010 the White House announced that it was cancelling a stop at the Golden Temple during Obama's trip to India. The decision to cancel was received with disappointment by the Sikh community, and it was speculated that the decision was in response to a photo that was circulated during the 2008 campaign of <b>Obama</b> wearing Kenyan traditional wardrobe during a 2006 trip to Kenya. The 2006 photo was used to raise doubts about Obama's religion. == Claim that <b>Obama</b> is the Antichrist == During the 2008 presidential campaign, one chain e-mail accused <b>Obama</b> of secretly being the biblical Antichrist, saying: According to The Book of Revelations the anti-christ is: The anti-christ will be a man, in his 40s, of MUSLIM descent, who will deceive the nations with persuasive language, and have a MASSIVE Christ-like appeal....the prophecy says that people will flock to him and he will promise false hope and world peace, and when he is in power, he will destroy everything is it OBAMA? PolitiFact.com has analyzed the elements in this false claim and debunked each one: The word Antichrist does not appear in the Book of Revelation (though it does appear in 1 John and 2 John); the Book of Revelation instead refers to The Beast. The Book of Revelation never mentions the Beast's age, nor does it include any references to \"Muslim descent\", as the religion of Islam was not founded until hundreds of years after the book was written. == Others == During the 2008 United States presidential election, psychologist Alan J. Lipman wrote a fictitious parody account of a \"Dr. Negative\" grouping things such as drug use, adultery, Cubism, miscegenation, and Pandeism as things candidate John McCain could accuse political opponent Barack <b>Obama</b> of. The following year, conservative blogger Mark Finkelstein in fact labeled Obama, along with Al Gore, and New York Times columnist Gail Collins as Pandeists, in a piece titled \"Happy Pan-Deism Day From Gail Collins\". Collins having noted the coincidence of Easter and Passover falling in the same week, wrote that \"Americans with less religious inclinations can look forward to the upcoming Earth Day celebrations, when the president is planning to do something as yet unannounced, but undoubtedly special, and Arbor Day, when rumor has it that he will not just plant a tree, but personally reforest a large swath of the nation of Mali\". Finkelstein retorted that: Environmentalism has essentially become a religion, and Earth Day effectively a religious holiday. Yesterday's pan-deists, who worshiped trees and brooks, have become members of various environmental groups doing much the same thing. People like Al Gore others, and perhaps the reforesting Obama, have become their latter day shamans. == See also == Crypto-Islam Islamophobia Xenophobia == References == == External links == <b>Obama</b> Conspiracy Theories watchdog website <b>Obama</b> E-mail Timeline, The Washington Post, June 28, 2008 Taranto, James (March 25, 2010). \"'Wingnuts': An Autobiography?

As with conspiracy theories surrounding his citizenship status, the claims are promoted by various political opponents, with American bloggers and conservative talk radio hosts particularly promoting the theories. Belief in these claims in the public sphere endured and, in some cases, even expanded during Obama's presidency according to the Pew Research Center, with 17% of Americans (including one third of conservative Republicans) believing him to be a Muslim in a 2012 poll.Obama practices Protestant Christianity. He attended Black churches while in his twenties. From 1992 until 2008, he was a member of the Trinity United Church of Christ\u2014a Reformed denomination. <b>Obama</b> left it in the wake of the Jeremiah Wright controversy. Since then, he has attended various Protestant churches, including Baptist, Methodist, and Episcopalian churches.", "Words": ["Obama", "Biden"]}, {"title": "Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories", "content": "During Barack Obama's campaign for president in 2008, throughout his presidency and afterwards, there was extensive news coverage of Obama's religious preference, birthplace, and of the individuals questioning his religious belief and citizenship \u2013 efforts eventually known as the \"birther movement\", by which name it is widely referred to across media. The movement falsely asserted <b>Obama</b> was ineligible to be President of the United States because he was not a natural-born citizen of the United States as required by Article Two of the Constitution. Studies have found these birther conspiracy theories to be most firmly held by Republicans strong in both political knowledge and racial resentment.Theories alleged that Obama's published birth certificate was a forgery \u2013 that his actual birthplace was not Hawaii but Kenya. Other theories alleged that <b>Obama</b> became a citizen of Indonesia in childhood, thereby losing his U.S. citizenship. Still others claimed that <b>Obama</b> was not a natural-born U.S. citizen because he was born a dual citizen (British and American). A number of political commentators have characterized these various claims as a racist reaction to Obama's status as the first African-American president of the United States.These claims were promoted by fringe theorists (pejoratively referred to as \"birthers\"), including businessman and television personality Donald Trump, who would later succeed <b>Obama</b> as president. Some theorists sought court rulings to declare <b>Obama</b> ineligible to take office, or to grant access to various documents which they claimed would support such ineligibility; none of these efforts succeeded. Some political opponents, especially in the Republican Party, expressed skepticism about Obama's citizenship or were unwilling to acknowledge it; some proposed legislation that would require presidential candidates to provide proof of eligibility.Theories have persisted despite Obama's pre-election release of his official Hawaiian birth certificate in 2008, confirmation by the Hawaii Department of Health based on the original documents, the April 2011 release of a certified copy of Obama's original Certificate of Live Birth (or long-form birth certificate), and contemporaneous birth announcements published in Hawaii newspapers. Polls conducted in 2010 (before the April 2011 release) suggested that at least 25% of adult Americans said that they doubted Obama's U.S. birth, and a May 2011 Gallup poll found that the percentage had fallen to 13% of American adults (23% of Republicans). The fall was attributed to Obama's release of the long form in April 2011. == Background == === Early life of Barack <b>Obama</b> === People who express doubts about Obama's eligibility or reject details about his early life are often informally called \"birthers\", a term that parallels the nickname \"truthers\" for adherents of 9/11 conspiracy theories. These conspiracy theorists reject at least some of the following facts about his early life: Barack <b>Obama</b> was born on August 4, 1961, at Kapi'olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital (now called Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women & Children) in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Ann Dunham, from Wichita, Kansas, and her husband Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr., a Luo from Nyang'oma Kogelo, Nyanza Province (in what was then the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya), who was attending the University of Hawaii. Birth notices for Barack <b>Obama</b> were published in The Honolulu Advertiser on August 13 and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin on August 14, 1961. Obama's father's immigration file also clearly states Barack <b>Obama</b> was born in Hawaii. One of his high school teachers, who was acquainted with his mother at the time, remembered hearing about the day of his birth.Obama's parents were divorced in 1964. He attended kindergarten in 1966\u20131967 at Noelani Elementary School in Honolulu. In 1967, his mother married Indonesian student Lolo Soetoro, who was also attending the University of Hawaii, and the family moved to Jakarta, Indonesia, where <b>Obama</b> attended the Catholic St. Francis of Assisi School before transferring to State Elementary School Menteng 01, an elite Indonesian public school in Menteng. As a child in Indonesia, <b>Obama</b> was called \"Barry Soetoro\", reflecting his stepfather's surname, or \"Barry Obama\", using his father's surname. When he was ten years old, <b>Obama</b> returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham, and has resided continuously in the United States since 1971. === Origins of the claims === In 1991, Obama's literary agency, Acton & Dystel, printed a promotional booklet which misidentified Obama's birthplace, and stated that <b>Obama</b> was \"born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii\". This error was later included in a biography that remained posted to their website until April 2007. The booklet's editor said that this incorrect information, which was not widely discovered until 2012, had been her mistake and not based on anything provided to her agency by Obama.Conspiracy theories about Obama's religion appeared at least as early as his 2004 U.S. Senate campaign in a press release by Illinois political candidate Andy Martin, and, according to a Los Angeles Times editorial, as Internet rumors.From the start of March 2008, rumors that <b>Obama</b> was born in Kenya before being flown to Hawaii were spread on conservative websites, with the suggestion that this would disqualify <b>Obama</b> from the presidency. In April of that year, some supporters of Hillary Clinton circulated anonymous chain emails repeating the same rumor; among them was an Iowa campaign volunteer, who was fired when the story emerged. These and numerous other chain e-mails during the subsequent presidential election circulated false rumors about Obama's origin, religion, and birth certificate.On June 9, 2008, Jim Geraghty of the conservative website National Review Online suggested that <b>Obama</b> release his birth certificate. Geraghty wrote that releasing his birth certificate could debunk several false rumors circulating on the Internet, namely: that his middle name was originally Muhammad rather than Hussein; that his mother had originally named him \"Barry\" rather than \"Barack\"; and that Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr. was not his biological father, as well as the rumor that Barack <b>Obama</b> was not a natural-born citizen.In August 2008, Philip J. Berg, a former member of the Democratic State Committee of Pennsylvania, brought an unsuccessful lawsuit against Obama, which alleged \"that <b>Obama</b> was born in Mombasa, Kenya.\"In October 2008, an NPR article referred to \"Kenyan-born\" Senator Barack Obama. Also that month, anonymous e-mails circulated claiming that the Associated Press (AP) had reported <b>Obama</b> was \"Kenyan-born\". The claims were based on an AP story that had appeared five years earlier in a Kenyan publication, The Standard. The rumor-checking website Snopes.com found that the headline and lead-in sentence describing <b>Obama</b> as born in Kenya and misspelling his first name had been added by the Kenyan newspaper, and did not appear in the story issued by the AP or in any other contemporary newspaper that picked up the AP story.In 2012, the far-right website Breitbart published a copy of the promotional booklet printed by Acton & Dystel in 1991. == Release of the birth certificates == === Short form, 2008 === On June 12, 2008, Obama's campaign responded to the rumors by posting an image of Obama's birth certificate on the \"Fight the Smears\" website.The image is a scan of a laser-printed document obtained from and certified by the Hawaii Department of Health on June 6, 2007. It is a \"Certification of Live Birth\", sometimes referred to as a short form birth certificate, and contains less information than the longer \"Certificate of Live Birth\", which Hawaii no longer issues. Asked about this, Hawaiian Department of Health spokeswoman Janice Okubo explained that Hawaii stopped issuing the longer \"Certificate\" in 2001 when their birth records were \"put into electronic files for consistent reporting\", and therefore Hawaii \"does not have a short-form or long-form certificate\". A \"record of live birth\", partially handwritten and partially typed, was created and submitted in 1961 when <b>Obama</b> was born, and is \"located in a bound volume in a file cabinet on the first floor of the state Department of Health\". The document was used to create the state's electronic records, and has been examined by state officials multiple times since the controversy began.In releasing the certificate, the <b>Obama</b> website declared that the rumors \"aren't actually about that piece of paper \u2013 they're about manipulating people into thinking Barack is not an American citizen.\" The campaign also provided the Daily Kos blog with a copy of the document. Referring to this release, National Review columnist Jim Geraghty, wrote on June 12, 2008: ... this document is what he or someone authorized by him was given by the state out of its records. Barring some vast conspiracy within the Hawaii State Department of Health, there is no reason to think his [original] birth certificate would have any different data. Frequent arguments of those questioning Obama's eligibility related to the fact that he did not originally release a copy of his \"original\" or \"long form\" birth certificate, but rather a \"short form\" version that did not include all of the information given on 1961 Hawaii-issued birth certificates. It was claimed that the use of the term \"certification of live birth\" on the first document means it is not equivalent to a \"birth certificate\". These arguments have been debunked numerous times by media investigations, every judicial forum that has addressed the matter, and Hawaiian government officials \u2013 among whom a consensus has been reached that the document released by the <b>Obama</b> campaign is indeed his official birth certificate. The director of the state Department of Human Health confirmed that the state \"has Senator Obama's original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures\". The short form is \"prima facie evidence of the fact of birth in any court proceeding.\"Arizona Tea Party leader and legislator Kelly Townsend pressed legislation to stop <b>Obama</b> from appearing on the ballot in the 2012 election in Arizona without providing proof of birth and also approached Donald Trump with the conspiracy. ==== Rejection by conspiracy theorists ==== The release of the certificate in 2008 resulted in a fresh round of questions. It was asserted that the certificate had been digitally forged with Adobe Photoshop and lacked a stamped seal of the state, which led them to demand that <b>Obama</b> release his \"original\" 1961 birth certificate. Jerome Corsi, author of the book The <b>Obama</b> Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality, told Fox News that \"the campaign has a false, fake birth certificate posted on their website ... it's been shown to have watermarks from Photoshop. It's a fake document that's on the Web site right now, and the original birth certificate the campaign refuses to produce.\" This view was rejected by FactCheck.org, which viewed the <b>Obama</b> campaign's hard copy of the Certification of Live Birth and reported that: FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate. We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship. Claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false. We have posted high-resolution photographs of the document as \"supporting documents\" to this article. Our conclusion: <b>Obama</b> was born in the U.S.A. just as he has always said. Corsi continued to cast doubt on Obama's birth certificate as late as March 2019. In a CNN interview, he stated, \"I want to see the original 1961 birth records from Kenya, that'll settle it ... the State of Hawaii will not show those records to anyone.\" Corsi's attorney, Larry Klayman, falsely asserted during the same interview, \"the birth certificate uses the word 'African-American' in 1961.\" ==== Hawaii Department of Health response ==== The director of Hawaii's Department of Health, Chiyome Fukino, issued a statement confirming that the state held Obama's \"original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures\". Noting \"there have been numerous requests for Senator Barack Hussein Obama's official birth certificate,\" Fukino explained that the department was prohibited by state law from releasing it to \"persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record\". She said: \"No state official, including Governor Linda Lingle, has ever instructed that this vital record be handled in a manner different from any other vital record in the possession of the State of Hawaii.\"According to the website TVNewser, CNN's researchers stated in 2009 that the original birth certificate no longer existed, as Hawaii discarded all paper birth records in 2001, and the certification of live birth was the official copy. Contradicting this report, Janice Okubo, public information officer for the Hawaii DOH, said \"We don't destroy vital records.\" The Health Department's director emphasized the assertion: I, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, director of the Hawaii State Department of Health, have seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawaii State Department of Health verifying Barack Hussein <b>Obama</b> was born in Hawaii and is a natural-born American citizen. I have nothing further to add to this statement or my original statement issued in October 2008, over eight months ago. Joshua Wisch, a spokesman for the Hawaii Attorney General's office, stated in 2011 that the original \"long form\" birth certificate \u2013 described by Hawaiian officials as a \"record of live birth\" kept in the archives of the Hawaii Department of Health is \"... a Department of Health record and it can't be released to anybody\", including President Obama. Wisch added that state law does not authorize photocopying such records. === Long form, 2011 === On April 22, 2011, <b>Obama</b> asked Loretta Fuddy, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, for certified copies of his original Certificate of Live Birth (\"long-form birth certificate\"). Accompanying the letter was a written request from Judith Corley, Obama's personal counsel, requesting a waiver of the department's policy of issuing only computer-generated certificates. Corley stated that granting the waiver would relieve the department of the burden of repeated inquiries into the President's birth records.On April 25, 2011, Fuddy approved the request and witnessed the copying process as the health department's registrar issued the certified copies. The same day, Corley personally visited the department headquarters in Honolulu to pay the required fee on Obama's behalf, and received the two requested certified copies of the original birth certificate, an accompanying letter from Fuddy attesting to the authenticity of same, and a receipt for the processing fee. Fuddy said that she had granted the exception to its normal policy of issuing only computer-generated copies by virtue of Obama's status, in an effort to avoid ongoing requests for the birth certificate.On April 27, 2011, White House staffers gave reporters a copy of the certificate, and posted a PDF image of the certificate on the White House website. The certificate reconfirmed the information on the official short-form certificate released in 2008, and provided additional details such as the name of the hospital at which <b>Obama</b> was born. ==== Rejection by conspiracy theorists ==== A claim put forth by the Drudge Report that the newly released document was a forgery made with image editing software quickly spread on the Internet. Nathan Goulding, chief technology officer of the National Review magazine, dismissed the matter of \"layered components\" found in the White House PDF by suggesting \"that whoever scanned the birth certificate in Hawaii forgot to turn off the OCR setting on the scanner.\" Nathan added, \"I've confirmed that scanning an image, converting it to a PDF, optimizing that PDF, and then opening it up in Illustrator, does in fact create layers similar to what is seen in the birth certificate PDF. You can try it yourself at home.\" ==== \"Showing papers\" ==== Goldie Taylor, a commentator for the African American news site The Grio, characterized the demand that <b>Obama</b> provide his birth certificate as an equivalent of making him \"show his papers\", as blacks were once required to do under Jim Crow laws. Sociologist Matthew W. Hughey has cited many of the claims as evidence of racial \"othering\" of <b>Obama</b> against the conflation of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) subject as the ideal and authentic American citizen. == False claims == === Born in Kenya === Some opponents of Obama's presidential eligibility claim that he was born in Kenya and was therefore not born a United States citizen. Whether <b>Obama</b> having been born outside the U.S. would have invalidated his U.S. citizenship at birth is debated. Political commentator Andrew Malcolm, of the Los Angeles Times, wrote that <b>Obama</b> would still be eligible for the presidency, regardless of where he was born, because his mother was an American citizen, saying that Obama's mother \"could have been on Mars when wee Barry emerged and he'd still be American.\" A contrary view is promoted by UCLA Law Professor Eugene Volokh, who has said that in the hypothetical scenario that <b>Obama</b> was born outside the U.S., he would not be a natural-born citizen, since the then-applicable law would have required Obama's mother to have been in the U.S. at least \"five years after the age of 14\", but Ann Dunham was three months shy of her 19th birthday when <b>Obama</b> was born. ==== Obama's paternal step-grandmother's version of events ==== An incorrect but popularly reported claim is that his father's stepmother, Sarah Obama, told Anabaptist Bishop Ron McRae in a recorded transatlantic telephone conversation that she was present when <b>Obama</b> was born in Kenya.The McClatchy newspapers gave an explanation of how the story about Obama's step-grandmother began. The tape is cut off in the middle of the conversation, before the passage in which she clarifies her meaning: \"'Obama was not born in Mombasa. He was born in America,' the translator says after talking to the woman. ... Another response later says, 'Obama in Hawaii. Hawaii. She says he was born in Hawaii.'\"Sarah <b>Obama</b> shed more light on the controversy in a 2007 interview with the Chicago Tribune, in which she stated that six months after Barack <b>Obama</b> Sr. and Ann Dunham were married, she received a letter at her home in Kenya announcing the birth of Barack <b>Obama</b> II, who was born August 4, 1961.In a June 2012 interview at her Kenyan home, Sarah <b>Obama</b> was asked: \"Some people want to believe that the president was born in Kenya. Have these people ever bothered you or asked for his birth certificate?\" Her response was: \"But Barack <b>Obama</b> wasn't born in Kenya.\" ==== Fake Kenyan birth certificate ==== On August 2, 2009, Orly Taitz released and attached to court documents a purported Kenyan birth certificate which she said, if authenticated and shown to be genuine, would significantly narrow and shorten the discovery and pre-trial litigation period in the Keyes v. Bowen lawsuit, in which the plaintiffs asked for a judicial order that <b>Obama</b> provide documentation that he is a natural-born citizen of the United States. Legal papers submitted describe the document as an \"unauthenticated color photocopy of certified copy of registration of birth\". The document was almost immediately revealed to be a forgery. It purports to have been issued by the \"Republic of Kenya\", when in fact, such a state did not yet exist at the time of Obama's birth as indicated on the document (Kenya was a British Colony until 1963).Subsequently, evidence was unearthed that the alleged Kenyan birth certificate was a modified version of a 1959 Australian birth certificate found on an online genealogy website. The Washington Independent website cited an anonymous blogger as having taken responsibility for the forgery and posting four photos substantiating his claim. === Not born in Hawaii === Despite the existence of Obama's Hawaii certification of live birth, Terry Lakin's attorney, among others, have claimed that anyone, including foreign-born children, could acquire a Hawaiian certification of live birth, and so Obama's possession of such a certificate does not prove that he was born in Hawaii. However, the suggestion that this could have applied to <b>Obama</b> was rejected by Janice Okubo, director of communications for the Hawaii Department of Health: \"If you were born in Bali, for example, you could get a certificate from the state of Hawaii saying you were born in Bali. You could not get a certificate saying you were born in Honolulu. The state has to verify a fact like that for it to appear on the certificate.\" Another fact that refutes this specific claim is that the law allowing foreign-born children to obtain Hawaiian birth certificates did not exist until 20 years after <b>Obama</b> was born, while Obama's published birth certificate says his birth information was recorded four days after his birth in 1961, and explicitly states that he was born in Honolulu.Additionally, some people claim that the information in the birth certificate only has to be based on the testimony of one parent.On July 27, 2009, Fukino issued a statement explicitly stating she has \"seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawaii State Department of Health verifying Barack Hussein <b>Obama</b> was born in Hawaii and is a natural-born American citizen\".Hawaiian Department of Health spokeswoman Janice Okubo elaborated on state policy for the release of vital records: \"If someone from Obama's campaign gave us permission in person and presented some kind of verification that he or she was Obama's designee, we could release the vital record.\"A hospital spokesperson at Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women & Children has said that their standard procedure is to neither confirm nor deny <b>Obama</b> was born there, \"even though all the information out there says he was born at Kapiolani Hospital\", citing federal privacy laws. In 1961, birth notices for Barack <b>Obama</b> were published in both the Honolulu Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin on August 13 and 14, 1961, respectively, listing the home address of Obama's parents as 6085 Kalanianaole Highway in Honolulu. On November 9, 2008, in response to the persistent rumors, the Advertiser posted on its web site a screenshot of the announcement taken from its microfilmed archives. Such notices were sent to newspapers routinely by the Hawaii Department of Health.In an editorial published on July 29, 2009, the Star-Bulletin pointed out that both newspapers' vital-statistics columns are available on microfilm in the main state library. \"Were the state Department of Health and Obama's parents really in cahoots to give false information to the newspapers [...]?\" the newspaper asked. === Lost U.S. citizenship === It has been suggested that <b>Obama</b> obtained Indonesian citizenship (and thus may have lost U.S. citizenship) when he lived there as a child. As an attempt to prove that <b>Obama</b> was no longer a U.S. citizen (or held dual citizenship), some claim his 1981 trip to Pakistan took place at a time when there was supposedly a ban on United States passport holders entering that country, which would in turn have required him to use a non-U.S. passport. There was in fact no such ban. A New York Times article and U.S. State Department travel advisories from 1981 make it clear that travel to Pakistan by U.S. passport holders was legal at that time.An April Fools' Day hoax email circulated on the Internet starting in 2009. It falsely claimed that <b>Obama</b> applied to Occidental College under the name \"Barry Soetoro\" claiming to be \"a foreign student from Indonesia\" in order to obtain a Fulbright scholarship (which does not exist for undergraduate students from Indonesia). == Disputes over \"natural-born citizen\" requirements == Another theory of Obama's ineligibility is that, regardless of his place of birth, he does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States ...\" According to law professor Gabriel J. Chin, \"there is agreement that 'natural born citizens' include those made citizens by birth under the 14th Amendment.\"Despite this agreement, two similar but distinct theories nonetheless contend Obama, although born in Hawaii, does not qualify as a \"natural-born citizen\". === Parental citizenship === Some campaigners, such as the Tennessee-based Liberty Legal Foundation, contend that in order for a person to be a natural-born citizen within the meaning of Article II, Section 1, it is necessary that both parents be U.S. citizens at the time of that person's birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that since Obama's father was not a U.S. citizen, <b>Obama</b> could not have been a natural-born citizen, and is therefore ineligible to be President of the United States. The Liberty Legal Foundation has cited a passage in the decision on an 1875 voting rights case which came before the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 Minor v. Happersett \u2013 in which the court stated there was no doubt that \"all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens\" were natural-born citizens. This legal theory on Obama's eligibility was unsuccessfully litigated several times, most notably in Ankeny v. Governor of the State of Indiana (2008). === Dual citizenship with United Kingdom === Others, including New Jersey attorney Leo Donofrio, in Donofrio v. Wells, have claimed that a person cannot be a natural-born citizen if he is a dual citizen at birth. Donofrio argued that because Obama's father was a British subject at the time <b>Obama</b> was born, <b>Obama</b> was born a dual citizen and therefore was not a natural-born citizen. The case was referred to the US Supreme Court by Justice Clarence Thomas, but on December 8, 2008, the Court declined without comment to hear it. === Dual citizenship with Kenya === In August 2008, the Rocky Mountain News ran an online article asserting that <b>Obama</b> is both a U.S. and a Kenyan citizen. <b>Obama</b> actually was born a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) under British law, by virtue of his descent from a Kenyan father at a time when Kenya was a British colony, but lost CUKC citizenship and became a Kenyan citizen when Kenya gained independence in 1963. However, Kenya's 1963 constitution prohibited dual citizenship in adulthood; <b>Obama</b> therefore automatically lost his Kenyan citizenship on his 23rd birthday in 1984, by failing to formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya. The Rocky Mountain News apologized for the error and published a correction, but the article continued to fuel online rumors about Obama's eligibility for the presidency. The current Kenyan constitution, effective since 2010, permits dual citizenship, but requires those who lost Kenyan citizenship prior to 2010 to complete a registration process to regain it. == Campaigners and proponents == Notable advocates of the view that <b>Obama</b> may not be eligible for the Presidency include Philip J. Berg, a Pennsylvania attorney and 9/11 conspiracy theorist. Berg describes himself as a \"moderate to liberal\" Democrat who backed Hillary Clinton for president. Another notable advocate is Alan Keyes, who was defeated by <b>Obama</b> in the 2004 Illinois U.S. Senate election, served as a diplomat in the Reagan administration, and is currently a media personality and self-described \"conservative political activist\".Orly Taitz, a California dentist and attorney who emigrated from the Soviet Union to Israel, then to the United States, and holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, has been called the \"queen bee of the birthers\", because she is often seen as the face of the movement.Other notable advocates include Andy Martin, a perennial candidate who was \"widely credited with starting the cyberwhisper campaign\" that <b>Obama</b> is a secret Muslim, and Robert L. Schulz, a tax protester and activist who placed full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune in December 2008 arguing that <b>Obama</b> had been born in Kenya or had subsequently renounced U.S. citizenship. Larry Klayman, founder of both Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch, expressed doubts about Obama's natural-born citizenship. The Constitution Party, a paleoconservative third party, also campaigned for release of Obama's original long-form certificate. In December 2008, Alex Koppelman, a senior writer for Salon, characterized nearly all of the prominent people promoting the story <b>Obama</b> was not eligible to be president \u2013 including Jerome Corsi, Philip Berg, Andy Martin, and Robert Schultz \u2013 as having a \"history of conspiracist thought\".The website AmericaMustKnow.com encouraged visitors to lobby members of the Electoral College to vote against Obama's confirmation as President and become faithless electors. Electors around the country received numerous letters and e-mails contending that Obama's birth certificate is a forgery and that he was born in Kenya, and requesting that <b>Obama</b> be denied the presidency. Some of the online campaigners coordinated their efforts with weekly conference calls, in which they discussed the latest news and how to advance the story.The campaign was supported by the conservative WorldNetDaily (WND) website, which sponsored a letter-writing campaign to the Supreme Court. WND's publisher Joseph Farah has written a number of editorials arguing that Obama's eligibility needs to be confirmed. WND has mounted an advertising campaign, using electronic billboards to ask \"Where's The Birth Certificate?\"The talk radio hosts Michael Savage, G. Gordon Liddy, Brian Sussman, Lars Larson, Bob Grant, Jim Quinn, Rose Tennent, Barbara Simpson, Mark Davis, and Fred Grandy have all promoted the ineligibility claims on their radio shows. Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs have also broached the issue several times on their shows. Savage, during an episode of his nationally syndicated radio show The Savage Nation, said that \"We're getting ready for the Communist takeover of America with a noncitizen at the helm.\"Some celebrities have promoted or touched upon the ineligibility claims. In August 2009, actor Chuck Norris, while not embracing the eligibility claims, wrote an open letter to <b>Obama</b> urging that he officially release his \"original birth certificate\", saying, \"Refusing to post your original birth certificate is an unwise political and leadership decision that is enabling the 'birther' controversy.\" In December 2010, Baltimore Orioles baseball player Luke Scott asserted in a Yahoo! interview that <b>Obama</b> \"was not born here\" and that his birth certificate was never released. The Huffington Post reported that, in April 2011 during his stage show, Charlie Sheen said, \"For starters, I was fucking born here, how about that? And I got proof! Nothing photoshopped about my birth certificate.\"According to Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, \"the birther movement has gained a large following on the radical right ... it has been adopted by the most noxious elements out there.\" Some of those \"noxious elements\" include a number of avowed white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups. James Wenneker von Brunn, an avowed white supremacist charged as the gunman in the June 10, 2009, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum shooting, had previously posted messages to the Internet accusing <b>Obama</b> and the media of hiding documents about his life.In March 2017, after <b>Obama</b> was no longer the president, Malik Obama, his paternal half brother, posted on Twitter an image of a fake Kenyan birth certificate, which had been \"debunked\" in 2009 when it was first presented as part of one of the failed lawsuits that challenged Obama's ineligibility. === Donald Trump === Donald Trump was a prominent promoter of birther conspiracy theories. This elevated Trump's political profile in the years leading up to his successful 2016 presidential campaign. According to political scientists John M. Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck, Trump \"became a virtual spokesperson for the 'birther' movement. When Trump suggested running for president in 2011, his popularity was concentrated among the sizable share of Republicans who thought that President <b>Obama</b> was foreign born or a Muslim or both.\"In 2010, at the urging of Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen, the National Enquirer began promoting a potential Trump presidential campaign, and with Cohen's involvement, the tabloid began questioning Obama's birthplace and citizenship.In March 2011, during an interview on Good Morning America, Donald Trump said he was seriously considering running for president, that he was a \"little\" skeptical of Obama's citizenship, and that someone who shares this view should not be so quickly dismissed as an \"idiot\" (as Trump considers the term \"birther\" to be \"derogatory\"). Trump added, \"Growing up no one knew him,\" a claim ranked Pants-on-Fire by Politifact. Later, Trump appeared on The View repeating several times that \"I want him [Obama] to show his birth certificate.\" He speculated that \"there [was] something on that birth certificate that [Obama] doesn't like\", a comment which host Whoopi Goldberg described as \"the biggest pile of dog mess I've heard in ages\". On the March 30, 2011, edition of CNN Newsroom, anchor Suzanne Malveaux commented on Trump's statements, pointing out that she had made a documentary for which she had gone to Hawaii and spoken with people who knew <b>Obama</b> as a child. In an NBC TV interview broadcast on April 7, 2011, Trump said he would not let go of the issue, because he was not satisfied that <b>Obama</b> had proved his citizenship. After Trump began making his views public, he was contacted by Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily, who was reportedly on the phone with Trump every day for a week, providing Trump with a \"birther primer\", answers to questions, and advice. After <b>Obama</b> released his long-form birth certificate on April 27, 2011, Trump said \"I am really honored and I am really proud, that I was able to do something that nobody else could do.\"On October 24, 2012, Trump offered to donate five million dollars to the charity of Obama's choice in return for the publication of his college and passport applications before October 31, 2012.On September 16, 2016, as the Republican Party presidential nominee, Trump conceded that \"President Barack <b>Obama</b> was born in the United States. Period.\" Trump gave himself credit for putting the controversy to rest and also repeated a false claim that Hillary Clinton, his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and one of Obama's opponents in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, had started the controversy concerning Obama's place of birth in order to harm the candidacy of <b>Obama</b> while boosting her own. While those who did so were Clinton supporters, there is no evidence of Clinton or her campaign questioning Obama's birthplace. === Joe Arpaio === Volunteer investigators working under the direction of Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio have asserted that Obama's birth certificate is a computer-generated forgery. Rejecting this claim, an assistant to Hawaii's attorney general stated in July 2012 that \"President <b>Obama</b> was born in Honolulu, and his birth certificate is valid. ... Regarding the latest allegations from a sheriff in Arizona, they are untrue, misinformed and misconstrue Hawaii law.\" Arizona state officials, including Governor Jan Brewer and Secretary of State Ken Bennett, have also dismissed Arpaio's objections and accepted the validity of Obama's birth certificate. Alex Pareene, a staff writer for Salon, wrote regarding a May 2012 trip to Hawaii by Arpaio's people that \"I think we have long since passed the point at which I'd find this story believable in a fictional setting.\" In December 2016, Arpaio presented \"9 points of forgery\" that he said proved that the digital image of Obama's long form birth certificate was not authentic. He said he would submit his evidence to federal authorities. === Matthew Hill === Rep. Matthew Hill, one of a handful of Tennessee General Assembly members widely reported at the time to be birthers, demanded in 2009 that newly-elected president <b>Obama</b> should be compelled to present Hill and other Tennessee state legislators with a certified copy of his Hawaiian birth certificate. Hill interviewed birther conspiracy advocate Orly Taitz at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention in Nashville for a February 10, 2009, segment podcasted online by the IRN/USA Radio Network. During The Matthew Hill Show he stated: We've said on this program many times ... we've had people call in and say why are you picking on him? And I've said, \"Look it's really simple. If he is a U.S. citizen you produce the papers. If he's not a U.S. citizen, what does he do? He hides them. He's hiding them. We need the truth. We need the documents unsealed. We need to know what's going on. === Roy Moore === U.S. Senate candidate and former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court Roy Moore first questioned Obama's citizenship in 2008, and said in 2016 that he didn't believe <b>Obama</b> had natural-born citizenship. === Richard Shelby === In February 2009, the Cullman Times, an Alabama newspaper, reported that at a town hall meeting there, U.S. Senator from Alabama Richard Shelby was asked if there was any truth to the rumors that <b>Obama</b> was not a natural-born citizen. According to the Times report, Shelby said, \"Well his father was Kenyan and they said he was born in Hawaii, but I haven't seen any birth certificate. You have to be born in America to be president.\"A Shelby spokesperson denied the story, but the newspaper stood by it. === Roy Blunt === On July 28, 2009, Mike Stark approached Missouri Congressman Roy Blunt asking him about the conspiracy theory that Barack <b>Obama</b> is not a natural-born citizen. Blunt responded: \"What I don't know is why the President can't produce a birth certificate. I don't know anybody else that can't produce one. And I think that's a legitimate question. No health records, no birth certificate.\" Blunt's spokesperson later claimed that the quote was taken out of context. === Jean Schmidt === After giving a speech at the Voice of America Freedom Rally in West Chester, Ohio on September 5, 2009, Republican congresswoman Jean Schmidt replied to a woman who commented that <b>Obama</b> was ineligible for the Presidency, \"I agree with you. But the courts don't.\" Schmidt's office subsequently responded that a video clip of this comment was \"taken out of context\", and reiterated that her stated position is that <b>Obama</b> is a citizen.She had earlier voted to certify the Electoral College vote affirming his presidency, and had said she believes <b>Obama</b> is a U.S. citizen. === Nathan Deal === In November 2009, then-Representative Nathan Deal replied to a question about whether he believed that <b>Obama</b> \"is a native-born American citizen who is eligible to serve as president\" with a statement that \"I am joining several of my colleagues in the House in writing a letter to the President asking that he release a copy of his birth certificate so we can have an answer to this question.\" Contrasting the differing fates of Deal, who won the 2010 gubernatorial election in Georgia, and former Democratic Representative Cynthia McKinney, who lost her primary after endorsing 9/11 conspiracy theories, David Weigel of Slate noted: \"Dipping a toe into the birtherism fever swamp didn't stop Deal from winning a statewide primary.\" === Sarah Palin === During a December 3, 2009 interview on Rusty Humphries' radio talk show, Humphries asked Sarah Palin if she would make Obama's birth certificate a campaign issue in 2012, should she decide to run. Palin responded, \"I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't have a problem with that. I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers ... I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records \u2013 all of that is fair game. The McCain-Palin campaign didn't do a good enough job in that area.\"After news organizations and blogs picked up the quotation, Palin stated on her Facebook page that voters have the right to ask questions, and that she had herself never asked <b>Obama</b> to produce a birth certificate. She likened the questioning of Obama's birth certificate to questions raised during the 2008 presidential elections about her maternity to her son, Trig. This analogy was criticized by Mark Milian of the Los Angeles Times, who said: \"It's not like Barack <b>Obama</b> hosted a radio show and called her a baby faker.\" === Tracey Mann === Tracey Mann, a candidate running for Congress from Kansas in 2010, stated at a candidate forum that <b>Obama</b> should release his birth certificate to resolve the issue. In a radio interview, he said: \"I think the president of the United States needs to come forth with his papers and show everyone that he's an American citizen and put this issue to bed once and for all.\" In response, on July 21, 2010, The Hutchinson News, a local paper in Hutchinson, Kansas, withdrew their endorsement of Mann, saying that Mann \"questions the citizenship of President Barack <b>Obama</b> despite evidence that is irrefutable to most objective, rational people \u2013 including a birth certificate released by the Hawaii secretary of state and birth announcements printed in Honolulu's two major newspapers\". Mann responded that he was \"disappointed and mystified\" by the decision and that they had misunderstood his position, as he was \"not interested in pursuing this issue in Congress\" and had \"never had any interest in spending any time on the matter\". Mann was defeated in the Republican primary by state senator Tim Huelskamp. === David Vitter === At a townhall meeting in Metairie, Louisiana on July 11, 2010, Senator David Vitter said: \"I personally don't have standing to bring litigation in court, but I support conservative legal organizations and others who would bring that to court. I think that is the valid and most possibly effective grounds to do it.\" His campaign provided no additional comments. === Newt Gingrich === On September 11, 2010, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stated that <b>Obama</b> could only be understood by people who \"understand Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior\". While Gingrich did not define this behavior, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs accused Gingrich of \"trying to appeal to the fringe of people who don't believe the president was born in this country ... You would normally expect better of somebody who held the position of Speaker of the House, but look, it is political season, and most people will say anything, and Newt Gingrich does that on a, genuinely, on a regular basis.\" === Andy Martin === In December 2010, Andy Martin (plaintiff in Martin v. Lingle and self-described \"King of the Birthers\") announced his candidacy to seek the 2012 Republican nomination for the President of the United States. In February 2011, Martin's planned appearance at a Republican meeting in Deering, New Hampshire, was cancelled after his anti-Semitic past was discovered. === Mike Huckabee === On February 28, 2011, on Steve Malzberg's radio program Mike Huckabee, a 2008 candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, falsely claimed that <b>Obama</b> had been raised in Kenya and that \"[Obama] probably grew up hearing that the British were a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather.\" Huckabee, speaking on The O'Reilly Factor, said that he misspoke and intended to say Indonesia, characterizing his comment as a \"verbal gaffe\". === Michele Bachmann === In March 2011, Representative Michele Bachmann told conservative radio host Jeff Katz: \"I'll tell you one thing, if I was ever to run for president of the United States, I think the first thing I would do in the first debate is offer my birth certificate, so we can get that off the table.\" Previously on Good Morning America, when asked about Obama's origins, she replied, \"Well, that isn't for me to state. That's for the president to state.\" === Mike Coffman === On May 12, 2012, Mike Coffman, a congressman running for re-election in the Sixth Congressional District of Colorado, addressed a Republican fundraising event in Elbert County. Coffman stated that he did not know where <b>Obama</b> was born, and that <b>Obama</b> was \"in his heart ... just not an American.\" Coffman issued an apology on May 16, saying that he had misspoken and that he had confidence in Obama's citizenship and legitimacy as president. In a May 23 Denver Post op-ed piece, Coffman described his comment as \"inappropriate and boneheaded\". === Arizona electors === In December 2012, three of the eleven electors from Arizona who cast their votes for Mitt Romney raised doubts about Obama's birthplace. One was the chair of the Republican Party of Arizona, Tom Morrissey. Morrissey later insisted that he was not a birther, but said he was not convinced the birth certificate produced by <b>Obama</b> was real. == Political impact == Although claims about Obama's citizenship were evaluated in 2008 by the McCain campaign and ultimately rejected, they became a significant issue among sections of the political right. Activists unsuccessfully lobbied Republican members of Congress to reject the 2008 Electoral College vote and block Obama's election when it came before Congress for certification on January 8, 2009. By mid-2009, the natural born citizen issue was one of the hottest and most lucrative sources of fundraising for organizations on the right that raise funds through direct mail and telemarketing. Online petition sites such as that of Alan Keyes, who has been collecting signatures on the birth certificate issue, are a major source for generating mailing lists of movement conservatives. The web site WorldNetDaily published more than 200 articles on the subject by July 2009 and has sold billboards, bumper stickers and postcards asking \"Where's the birth certificate?\" and similar slogans in an effort which has \"already raised tens of thousands of dollars\".Moderate conservatives soon found themselves \"bombarded with birther stuff\". Protesters at the Tea Party protests in 2009 carried signs about the birth certificate issue, some of which were recommended by protest organizers. In an incident that attracted widespread media coverage, moderate Republican Representative Michael Castle was booed and heckled during a July 2009 town hall meeting in Georgetown, Delaware, when he told a woman protesting about Obama's birth certificate: \"if you're referring to the president there, he is a citizen of the United States.\"NBC Nightly News reported that other members of Congress often hear the issue too; an anonymous congressman told the program that he was reluctant to advertise his own town hall meetings for fear of this issue drowning out everything else.A number of Republican legislators have proposed legislation and constitutional amendments at the state and federal levels to address issues raised by the birth certificate campaigners. Some Republicans are said to \"want the issue to go away\", seeing it as a distraction. Democratic commentators have criticized the reluctance of some Republicans to distance themselves from the proponents of the conspiracy theories, suggesting that \"Republican officials are reluctant to denounce the birthers for fear of alienating an energetic part of their party's base.\" NBC News' \"First Read\" team commented: \"the real story in all of this is that Republican Party has a HUGE problem with its base right now.\"Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele released a statement through his spokesperson saying, \"Chairman Steele believes that this is an unnecessary distraction and believes that the president is a U.S. citizen.\"Political analyst Marc Ambinder of The Atlantic and CBS News suggests this phenomenon goes to the heart of the dilemma now facing the Republican Party, positing that Republican presidential candidates need to figure out how to diffuse [sic] angry birthers who are bound to show up and demand their attention. If they give credence to the birthers, they're not only advancing ignorance but also betraying the narrowness of their base. If they dismiss this growing movement, they might drive birthers to find more extreme candidates, which will fragment a Republican political coalition. Political analyst Andrew Sullivan, writing in The Sunday Times, stated The demographics tell the basic story: a black man is president and a large majority of white southerners cannot accept that, even in 2009. They grasp conspiracy theories to wish <b>Obama</b> \u2013 and the America he represents \u2013 \u2013 away. Since white southerners comprise an increasing proportion of the 22% of Americans who still describe themselves as Republican, the GOP can neither dismiss the crankery nor move past it. The fringe defines what's left of the Republican centre. On July 27, 2009, the House of Representatives passed a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of Hawaii's statehood. The resolution, containing language recognizing Hawaii as President Obama's birth state, passed by a vote of 378\u20130. === Opinion surveys === In October 2008, the Orange County Register's OC Political Pulse poll found that a third of responding Republicans believed that <b>Obama</b> had been born outside the United States. As a result of the widespread publicity given to the citizenship controversy, 60% of respondents in an Ohio State University survey carried out in November 2008 had heard of the issue. However, only 10% believed the claims that <b>Obama</b> was not a citizen.A Public Policy Polling survey carried out in August 2009 found that 32% of Republicans in Virginia thought that <b>Obama</b> was born in the U.S., 41% thought he was foreign-born and the remaining 27% were unsure.In Utah, an August 2009 poll carried out for the Deseret News and KSL-TV found that 67% of Utahns accepted the evidence that <b>Obama</b> was born in the U.S. The poll found that those who do not believe that <b>Obama</b> was born in the United States, or do not know, are predominantly middle-aged, lower-income Republican-leaning individuals without a college education.A Pew Research Center poll found that 80% of Americans had heard about the <b>Obama</b> citizenship claims by August 2009. The poll found a significant partisan divide in views of the news coverage, with 58% of Democrats saying that the allegations had received too much attention from the media. Republicans were more inclined to say that the allegations had received too little attention, with 39% expressing this view against only 26% saying that the controversy had received too much attention.In a Harris Poll online survey of 2,320 adults conducted in March 2010, 25% of the respondents said they believed that <b>Obama</b> was \"not born in the United States and so is not eligible to be president\". In a July 2010 CNN poll of adult Americans, 16% said they had doubts that <b>Obama</b> was born in the United States, and a further 11% were certain that he was not.The percentage of doubters plummeted after President <b>Obama</b> released the long form certificate in April 2011. A Gallup telephone poll of 1018 adults conducted in May 2011 found that 5% of respondents believed that <b>Obama</b> was \"definitely born in another country\" and 8% believed he was \"probably born in another country\", versus 47% believing he was \"definitely\" and 18% \"probably\" born in the US. Broken down by political affiliation, the same poll found that 23% of self-identified Republicans, 14% of independents, and 5% of Democrats thought <b>Obama</b> was definitely or probably born in another country.In July 2016, four months before Donald Trump was elected to the presidency, 41 percent of Republicans disagreed that <b>Obama</b> was born in the United States and 31 percent neither agreed nor disagreed, per an NBC poll.A 2015 study found that among individuals who held birther views, they were predominantly conservative/Republican and held anti-Black attitudes. A 2019 study found that \"among white Americans, birther beliefs are uniquely associated with racial animus.\" === Dilemma for Republicans === Because a portion of Republican voters and their Tea Party supporters believed <b>Obama</b> was not eligible to hold public office (see Opinion surveys section), Republicans sometimes found themselves caught in a dilemma between losing support or damaging their credibility. They had \"to walk the fine line of humoring conspiracy-minded supporters without explicitly questioning Obama's legitimacy ...\" Other Republicans, including former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, however, have plainly rejected these claims.An example of these situations was Michael Castle, then Representative for Delaware, who ran in 2010 for the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Joe Biden. At a town hall meeting, Castle was confronted by constituents who jeered him for insisting that <b>Obama</b> is a citizen of the United States. Castle, one of the leading Republican moderates in the House, was later defeated by Tea Party-backed Christine O'Donnell in the Republican primary, who herself later lost the general election to Democratic nominee Chris Coons. == Commentary and criticism == Proponents of claims doubting Obama's eligibility have been dubbed \"birthers\" by their critics, who have drawn a parallel with 9/11 conspiracy theorists or \"truthers\". Leslie Savan of The Nation has compared the so-called \"birthers\" to other groups as well, including those who deny the Moon landing, the Holocaust or global warming; \"Teabaggers who refuse to believe they must pay taxes\" and creationists who believe the earth is 6,000 years old. MSNBC political commentator Rachel Maddow has defined a \"birther\" as: A specific new breed of American conspiracy theorists who believe that the real problem with Barack <b>Obama</b> being president is that he can't possibly have been born in the United States. He's not eligible to be president. The birth certificate is a fake. He's a foreigner. Once this has been exposed, I guess, he will be run out of the White House ... A number of conservative commentators have criticized its proponents and their effect on the wider conservative movement. Talk show host Michael Medved has also been critical, calling them \"the worst enemy of the conservative movement\" for making other conservatives \"look sick, troubled and not suitable for civilized company\". Conservative columnist Ann Coulter has referred to them as \"just a few cranks\".An editorial in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin dismissed the claims about Obama's eligibility as proposing \"a vast conspiracy involving Obama's parents, state officials, the news media, the Secret Service, think-tanks and a host of yet-to-be-uncovered others who have connived since Obama's birth to build a false record so that he could eventually seek the presidency 47 years later.\" The St. Petersburg Times' fact-checking website, PolitiFact.com, concluded its series of articles on the birth certificate issue by saying: There is not one shred of evidence to disprove PolitiFact's conclusion that the candidate's name is Barack Hussein Obama, or to support allegations that the birth certificate he released isn't authentic. And that's true no matter how many people cling to some hint of doubt and use the Internet to fuel their innate sense of distrust. In November 2008, commentator and social critic Camille Paglia criticized the \"blathering, fanatical overkill\" of the topic, but also questioned Obama's response: \"Obama could have ended the entire matter months ago by publicly requesting Hawaii to issue a fresh, long-form, stamped certificate and inviting a few high-profile reporters in to examine the document and photograph it,\" she said. A parenthetical in the same article noted that \"the campaign did make the 'short-form' certificate available to Factcheck.org.\"Factcheck.org noted, \"The Hawaii Department of Health's birth record request form does not give the option to request a photocopy of your long-form birth certificate, but their short form has enough information to be acceptable to the State Department.\"Writing in December 2008, Alex Koppelman discussed the validity of the common argument \u2013 that <b>Obama</b> should release a copy of his full, original certificate and the rumors and doubts would disappear. Conspiracy theory experts told Koppelman that when committed conspiracists are presented with more data debunking their theory, they refuse to accept the new evidence. \"Whatever can't be ignored can be twisted to fit into the narrative; every new disclosure of something that should, by rights, end the controversy only opens up new questions, identifies new plotters,\" he wrote. Because Obama's release of the short-form had only \"stoked the fever of conspiracy mongers\", Koppelman predicted that releasing the long-form certificate \"would almost certainly\" continue the rumor cycle.In response to the notion that Obama's grandparents might have planted a birth announcement in newspapers just so their grandson could some day be president, FactCheck suggested that \"those who choose to go down that path should first equip themselves with a high-quality tinfoil hat.\" Brooks Jackson, the director of FactCheck, comments that \"it all reflects a surge of paranoid distress among people who don't like Barack Obama\" and who want the election results to go away. Chip Berlet, a journalist who has studied the spread of conspiracy theories, notes: For some people, when their side loses an election, the only explanation that makes sense to them \u2013 that they can cope with \u2013 is that sinister, bad, evil people arranged some kind of fraud. American political writer Dana Milbank, writing for The Washington Post, described the <b>Obama</b> citizenship theories of Bob Schulz (chairman of the We the People Foundation, which in 2008 publicly challenged Obama's citizenship) as \"tales from the tinfoil-hat brigade\". Colorado presidential elector Camilla Auger, responding to lobbying of members of the Electoral College, commented: \"I was concerned that there are that many nutty people in the country making depressing, absurd allegations.\"Some commentators have asserted that racism is a factor motivating the promotion of <b>Obama</b> citizenship conspiracy theories. J. Richard Cohen, the President of the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors hate groups and extremism, wrote an e-mail to supporters in July 2009 declaring: \"This conspiracy theory was concocted by an anti-Semite and circulated by racist extremists who cannot accept the fact that a black man has been elected president.\" An academic psychologist commented that a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology supported a conclusion that racism has played a role. Donald Trump's questioning how <b>Obama</b> gained admission to two Ivy-League institutions, as well as his comment, \"I have a great relationship with the blacks\", led David Remnick, David Letterman and Bill Maher, among others, to accuse Trump of racism, and an increased attention on race with respect to Obama. In April 2011, Marilyn Davenport, a Tea Party activist and member of the executive committee of the Republican Party's local Orange County, California, organization, created a nationwide controversy when she circulated a photograph by email, widely seen as racist, that had been edited to depict Barack <b>Obama</b> as the child of two chimpanzees, and to which she had added the caption, \"Now you know why no birth certificate\". Following the release of Obama's long-form certificate later that month, The New York Times remarked in an editorial that, \"It is inconceivable that this campaign to portray Mr. <b>Obama</b> as the insidious 'other' would have been conducted against a white president.\" == Legislation and litigation == The controversy over Obama's citizenship and eligibility for the presidency prompted a number of Republican state and federal legislators to propose legislation aimed at requiring future presidential candidates to release copies of their birth certificates. Some legislators also lent their support to birth certificate-related litigation against Obama, joining as co-plaintiffs.Although <b>Obama</b> was confirmed as president-elect by Congress on January 8, 2009, and sworn in as President on January 20, litigation continued into his presidency. Numerous individuals and groups filed state or federal lawsuits seeking to have <b>Obama</b> disqualified from standing or being confirmed for the Presidency, or to compel him to release additional documentation relating to his citizenship. By mid-December 2008, at least 17 lawsuits had been filed challenging Obama's eligibility in states including North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Connecticut, New Jersey, Texas and Washington. No such suit resulted in the grant of any relief to the plaintiffs by any court; all of the cases were rejected in lower courts. Three post-election suits were dismissed by the Supreme Court of the United States.In April 2011, the Arizona legislature became the first to pass a bill \"requiring President <b>Obama</b> and other presidential candidates to prove their U.S. citizenship before their names can appear on the state's ballot\". The bill, HB 2177, was vetoed by Governor Jan Brewer on April 18.Obama is not the first President to be the subject of controversy surrounding the location of his birth. Andrew Jackson was the subject of similar claims, although it is not certain that they were raised during his presidency. Some said that Chester A. Arthur was born outside the United States, with his birth records later allegedly falsified to show he was born in Vermont. == Impact on the 2012 presidential election and beyond == In May 2012, the Arizona Secretary of State, Ken Bennett, asked Hawaii to verify Obama's Hawaiian birth to ensure his eligibility to appear on the November ballot. After Bennett proved that he needed the information as part of the regular course of official business, Hawaii officially confirmed that the information in the copy of the Certificate of Live Birth for the President matches the original record in their files. Later the same month, the Mississippi state Democratic Party requested Hawaii to verify that the long-form image on the White House website matched the copy on file, and they were provided with a certified verification, bearing the state seal and signed by state registrar Alvin T. Onaka, who had certified both released birth certificates.In September 2012, the State Objections Board of Kansas, composed of \"three of the state's top elected Republicans\", delayed acting on a petition to remove Barack Obama's name from the ballot, requesting information from Hawaii regarding his birth certificate; however, they later voted unanimously to accept Obama's citizenship and retain him on the state's ballot, despite objections from the floor by Orly Taitz. == White House responses == A common claim among those arguing that President <b>Obama</b> was not born in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled if <b>Obama</b> released his \"long form\" birth certificate. However, commentators noted that doing so would be disadvantageous to Obama. First, it would encourage speculation as to why it took so long to release the document. Second, caving in to his political adversaries' demands would embolden them by giving them a victory. Finally, it would open the door to demands for other personal records unrelated to his birth certificate. Despite these concerns, both <b>Obama</b> and his press secretary have responded to reporters' questions about the issue. === Press secretary's response === At the end of the May 27, 2009, press briefing, WorldNetDaily reporter Lester Kinsolving asked about Obama's birth certificate. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs replied \"It's on the Internet\", to which Kinsolving responded \"No, no, no \u2013 the long form listing his hospital and physician\". Gibbs responded as follows: Lester, this question in many ways continues to astound me. The state of Hawaii provided a copy with the seal of the President's birth. I know there are apparently at least 400,000 people (laughter) that continue to doubt the existence of and the certification by the state of Hawaii of the President's birth there, but it's on the Internet because we put it on the Internet for each of those 400,000 to download. At a July 27, 2009, press briefing, radio talk show host Bill Press asked Gibbs if there was anything he could say to make the issue go away. Gibbs answered, \"No. I mean, the God's honest truth is no,\" because \"nothing will assuage\" those who continue to pursue what he called \"made-up, fictional nonsense\" despite the evidence that <b>Obama</b> had already provided.On August 6, 2009, Gibbs commented, \"You couldn't sell this script in Hollywood,\" and summarized the contentions that he considered \"totally crazy\": A pregnant woman leaves her home to go overseas to have a child \u2013 who there's not a passport for \u2013 so is in cahoots with someone ... to smuggle that child, that previously doesn't exist on a government roll somewhere back into the country and has the amazing foresight to place birth announcements in the Hawaii newspapers? All while this is transpiring in cahoots with those in the border, all so some kid named Barack <b>Obama</b> could run for President 46 and a half years later. === Barack Obama's response === At the February 2010 National Prayer Breakfast, <b>Obama</b> commented, \"Surely you can question my policies without questioning my faith. Or for that matter my citizenship.\" He directly addressed the issue in August 2010, in an interview with Brian Williams. Williams asked <b>Obama</b> about the fact that a fifth of the American people do not believe that he is either American born or a Christian. <b>Obama</b> responded that \"there is a mechanism, a network of misinformation that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly.\" He then added, \"I can't spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead.\"In an April 2011 interview with George Stephanopoulos, <b>Obama</b> said, \"I think that over the last two and a half years there's been an effort to go at me in a way that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. And so ... I think it presents a problem for them.\"On April 27, 2011, referring to \"sideshows and carnival barkers\", <b>Obama</b> appeared in the White House press room an hour after the release of the long form and said, \"I know there is going to be a segment of people for which no matter what we put out this issue will not be put to rest. But I am speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness. We've got better stuff to do.\" ==== Joking acknowledgements ==== On several occasions, <b>Obama</b> joked about the conspiracy theories surrounding his birth certificate and citizenship. At the 2010 White House Correspondents' Dinner, <b>Obama</b> said there are few things in life harder to find and more important to keep than love, and then added, \"Well, love and a birth certificate.\"At the 2011 Gridiron Dinner, <b>Obama</b> referred to Bruce Springsteen's song, \"Born in the U.S.A.\", and commented, \"Some things just bear repeating.\"On March 17, 2011 (Saint Patrick's Day), <b>Obama</b> said, \"Now, speaking of ancestry, there has been some controversy about my own background. Two years into my presidency, some are still bent on peddling rumors about my origins. So today, I want to put all those rumors to rest. It is true my great-great-great-grandfather really was from Ireland. It's true. Moneygall, to be precise. I can't believe I have to keep pointing this out.\"At the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner, following the release of his long-form Hawaiian birth certificate, <b>Obama</b> declared that he would \"go a step further\" and release his \"official birth video\"\u2014actually a clip from the opening of The Lion King (1994) where Simba is born in the African savanna\u2014after which he defeatedly remarked, \"Oh well. Back to square one.\" He then clarified \"to the Fox News table\" that he was indeed joking, and that they could contact Disney for the \"original long-form version\". Later in 2011, Obama's re-election campaign offered for sale mugs with a picture of <b>Obama</b> (captioned \"Made in the USA\") and the image of the birth certificate. The campaign states, \"There's really no way to make the conspiracy about President Obama's birth certificate completely go away, so we might as well laugh at it \u2013 and make sure as many people as possible are in on the joke.\"On January 17, 2012, during a televised tribute to actress Betty White on her 90th birthday, <b>Obama</b> taped a segment in which he wrote White a letter saying that, given her appearance and vitality, he not only could not believe she was 90, he did not believe her, and requested to see her birth certificate. == See also == Early life and career of Barack <b>Obama</b> Barack <b>Obama</b> religion conspiracy theories Birthright citizenship in the United States Chester A.

The movement falsely asserted <b>Obama</b> was ineligible to be President of the United States because he was not a natural-born citizen of the United States as required by Article Two of the Constitution. Studies have found these birther conspiracy theories to be most firmly held by Republicans strong in both political knowledge and racial resentment.Theories alleged that Obama's published birth certificate was a forgery \u2013 that his actual birthplace was not Hawaii but Kenya. Other theories alleged that <b>Obama</b> became a citizen of Indonesia in childhood, thereby losing his U.S. citizenship. Still others claimed that <b>Obama</b> was not a natural-born U.S. citizen because he was born a dual citizen (British and American). A number of political commentators have characterized these various claims as a racist reaction to Obama's status as the first African-American president of the United States.These claims were promoted by fringe theorists (pejoratively referred to as \"birthers\"), including businessman and television personality Donald Trump, who would later succeed <b>Obama</b> as president. Some theorists sought court rulings to declare <b>Obama</b> ineligible to take office, or to grant access to various documents which they claimed would support such ineligibility; none of these efforts succeeded. Some political opponents, especially in the Republican Party, expressed skepticism about Obama's citizenship or were unwilling to acknowledge it; some proposed legislation that would require presidential candidates to provide proof of eligibility.Theories have persisted despite Obama's pre-election release of his official Hawaiian birth certificate in 2008, confirmation by the Hawaii Department of Health based on the original documents, the April 2011 release of a certified copy of Obama's original Certificate of Live Birth (or long-form birth certificate), and contemporaneous birth announcements published in Hawaii newspapers. Polls conducted in 2010 (before the April 2011 release) suggested that at least 25% of adult Americans said that they doubted Obama's U.S. birth, and a May 2011 Gallup poll found that the percentage had fallen to 13% of American adults (23% of Republicans). The fall was attributed to Obama's release of the long form in April 2011.", "Words": ["Obama", "Biden"]}, {"title": "Barack Obama \"Hope\" poster", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster", "content": "The Barack <b>Obama</b> \"Hope\" poster is an image of US president Barack <b>Obama</b> designed by American artist Shepard Fairey. The image was widely described as iconic and came to represent Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. It is a stylized stencil portrait of <b>Obama</b> in solid red, beige and (light and dark) blue, with the word \"progress\", \"hope\", or \"change\" below (and other words in some versions). Fairey based the design on a photo taken by former Associated Press (AP) freelance photographer Mannie Garcia. He created the design in a day and printed it first as a street poster. It was then widely distributed\u2014both as a digital image and other paraphernalia\u2014during the 2008 election season, with approval from the <b>Obama</b> campaign. By July 2008, Sticker Robot had printed over 200,000 vinyl \"Hope\" stickers, 75% of which had been given away to support Obama's campaign. The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the <b>Obama</b> campaign. In January 2009, after <b>Obama</b> had won the election, Fairey's mixed-media stenciled portrait version of the image was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution for its National Portrait Gallery. Later that month, the photograph that Fairey based the poster on was identified and the AP began negotiations for compensation. Fairey sued for a declaratory judgment that his poster was a fair use of the photograph. The parties settled out of court in January 2011. In February 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty to destroying and fabricating evidence showing that he had used the photograph; in September, he was sentenced to two years of probation, 300 hours of community service, and a fine of $25,000. == Concept and design == In October 2007, Shepard Fairey, who had created political street art critical of the US government and George W. Bush, discussed the <b>Obama</b> presidential campaign with publicist Yosi Sergant. Sergant contacted the <b>Obama</b> campaign to seek permission for Fairey to design an <b>Obama</b> poster, which was granted a few weeks before Super Tuesday. Fairey decided to create a portrait of <b>Obama</b> based on his feeling that his \"power and sincerity as a speaker would create a positive association with his likeness\". Using Google Image Search, Fairey found a photograph of <b>Obama</b> taken by freelancer Mannie Garcia for the Associated Press, and created a poster design in a day. The original image had the word \"progress\" and featured Fairey's signature obey star\u2014a symbol associated with his Andre the Giant Has a Posse street art campaign\u2014embedded in the <b>Obama</b> campaign's sunrise logo. Due to the <b>Obama</b> campaign's concerns about the connotations of the word, Fairey changed the slogan printed under Obama's image from \"progress\" to \"hope\".According to design writer Steven Heller, the poster was inspired by social realism. Heller saw it as part of a tradition of contemporary artists drawing inspiration from political candidates and producing \"posters that break the mold not only in terms of color and style but also in message and tone\". Fairey cited a photo of John F. Kennedy and the image of Abraham Lincoln on the US five-dollar bill as inspirations. == Distribution during the 2008 campaign == Fairey began screen-printing posters soon after completing the design and showing it to Sergant. Initially, he sold 350 and put 350 more up in public. Beginning with that sale and continuing throughout the campaign, Fairey used proceeds from selling the image to produce more; after first printing, he made 4,000 more that were distributed at <b>Obama</b> rallies before Super Tuesday. He also put a printable digital version on his website. The image quickly went viral, spreading through social media and word of mouth.After the initial 600 posters, the <b>Obama</b> campaign conveyed through Sergant that they wanted to promote the theme of hope, and most of the posters sold by Fairey subsequently had the word \"hope\" and later \"change\" instead of \"progress\"; the obey star was also absent from later versions. By October 2008, Fairey and Sergant said they had printed 300,000 posters (with fewer than 2,000 sold and the rest given away or displayed). In addition, throughout the duration of the campaign, over 1,000,000 stickers were printed and disseminated by Stickerobot.com as well as clothing and other items with the image sold through Fairey's website. According to Fairey and Sergant, proceeds from sales of the image were used to produce more posters, stickers and other merchandise in support of the <b>Obama</b> campaign, rather than direct profit for Fairey.According to Guardian journalist Laura Barton, the image had \"acquired the kind of instant recognition of Jim Fitzpatrick's Che Guevara poster\".In an interview with Esquire in 2015, Fairey said that <b>Obama</b> had not met his expectations as president, citing his use of drones and domestic spying. == Parodies and imitations == As the campaign progressed, many parodies and imitations of Fairey's design appeared. For example, one anti-Obama version replaced the word \"hope\" with \"hype\", while parody posters featuring opponents Sarah Palin and John McCain had the word \"nope\". In January 2009, Paste launched a site allowing users to create their own versions of the poster. More than 10,000 images were uploaded to the site in its first two weeks.Mad parodied the \"hope\" poster with an \"Alfred E. Neuman for President!\" poster. Alfred was on the poster, and the word \"hope\" was replaced with \"hopeless\". Anti-Gaddafi protesters in Chicago, in solidarity with the 2011 Libyan civil war, have co-opted the image. Dynamite Comics released a four-part crossover with <b>Obama</b> and Ash Williams of their Army of Darkness comics and the Evil Dead films. One of the issues covers had a picture of Ash Williams (played by Bruce Campbell in the films) in the style of the \"Hope\" poster with the bottom text reading \"Hope?\" Fairey was also commissioned to create a number of works in the same style. He produced two other versions, based on different photographs, officially on behalf of the <b>Obama</b> campaign, and another to serve as the cover of the Person of the Year issue of Time. He also created a portrait of comedian Stephen Colbert in the same style, which appeared in an issue of Entertainment Weekly honoring Colbert's television show The Colbert Report.Firas Alkhateeb, the student who designed the controversial <b>Obama</b> \"Joker\" image, cited Fairey as his greatest influence. Alkhateeb described the \"Joker\" image as a corrective to Fairey's glowing portrayal of Obama. Fairey said he did not agree with its political content, but that the \"artwork is great in that it gets a point across really quickly\".The September 2009 issue of The Advocate, America's oldest-continuing LGBT publication, featured a cover image similar to Fairey's design. The blue and red coloring was replaced with pink and purple, but instead of \"hope\", the caption was \"nope?\". Jon Barrett, the magazine's editor-in-chief, said the cover expressed the frustration among some Democratic members of the LGBT community. === Honest Gil Fulbright === Shepard Fairey created an adaptation of the <b>Obama</b> HOPE poster for satirical Kentucky politician Honest Gil Fulbright. The poster features a portrait of Frank L. Ridley, the actor who portrays Fulbright, with the words \"SOLD,\" which refers to Fulbright's \"honest\" political message: \"I'm only in this thing for the money, but at least I'm honest about it.\" === Fairey's adaptation for the Occupy movement === Sympathizing with the Occupy movement, in November 2011 Shepard Fairey introduced a variation of his \"Hope\" poster. In the new poster, he featured a Guy Fawkes mask, and the message \"Mister President, we HOPE you're on our side\", with the word \"HOPE\" in large font and the rest of the sentence in small font. The <b>Obama</b> campaign logo on the right was replaced by a similar logo with the inscription \"We are the 99%\". == Acquisition by Smithsonian == On January 7, 2009, the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery announced it had acquired Fairey's hand-finished collage (stencil and acrylic on paper) version of the image (with the word \"hope\"), which the gallery said would go on display shortly before Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009. The work was commissioned and later donated by art collectors Heather and Tony Podesta, the brother of Obama's transition co-chairman John Podesta. It is an unusual acquisition, in that the National Portrait Gallery normally collects official portraits as presidents are leaving office rather than before they take office. == Origin and copyright == The source photograph Fairey based the poster on was not publicly known until after <b>Obama</b> had won the election. After a mistaken attribution to Reuters photographer Jim Young for a similar-looking January 2007 photograph, in January 2009 photographer and blogger Tom Gralish discovered that the poster was based on an Associated Press (AP) photograph by freelance photographer Mannie Garcia. Garcia took the photograph at a 2006 media event with Kansas senator Sam Brownback, where the actor George Clooney was raising awareness of the War in Darfur after a trip to Sudan he had taken with his father.In February 2009, the AP announced that it had determined \"that the photograph used in the poster is an AP photo and that its use required permission\" and announced it was in discussions with Fairey's attorney. Fairey was represented by Anthony Falzone, executive director of the Fair Use Project at Stanford University. Falzone was quoted in the press release: \"We believe fair use protects Shepard's right to do what he did here.\" Fairey subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against the AP, seeking a declaratory judgment that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the fair use doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright.In October 2009, Fairey admitted that he had based the poster on the AP photograph and had fabricated and destroyed evidence to hide the fact. Fairey's admission came after one of his employees told him that he had discovered relevant documents on an old hard drive. Realizing that these documents would reveal his cover-up, Fairey told the truth to his attorney.Garcia contended that he retained copyright to the photo according to his AP contract. He said that he was \"proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it had\", but that he did not \"condone people taking things, just because they can, off the internet\". Fairey countered that his conduct did not constitute \"improper appropriation\" because he had not taken any protected expression from Garcia's original photo. In addition, he claimed his behavior qualified as fair use. At trial AP would have to address both arguments.A judge urged a settlement, stating that AP would win the case. The AP and Shepard Fairey settled out of court in January 2011. In a press release, the AP announced that it and Fairey had \"agreed to work together going forward with the Hope image and share the rights to make the posters and merchandise bearing the Hope image and to collaborate on a series of images that Fairey will create based on AP photographs. The parties have agreed to additional financial terms that will remain confidential.\"In a separate criminal action, federal prosecutors suggested that Fairey should face prison time for the destruction of evidence in the case, with the government sentencing request stating that \"[a] sentence without any term of imprisonment sends a terrible message to those who might commit the same sort of criminal conduct. Encouraging parties to game the civil litigation system ... creates terrible incentives and subverts the truth-finding function of civil litigation.\" In September 2012, Fairey was sentenced to two years of probation, 300 hours of community service, and a fine of $25,000. == References == == External links == Obama\u2014original version from Fairey's website, obeygiant.com Fisher, William W.

The center will also include community and conference facilities and will house the nonprofit <b>Obama</b> Foundation. Construction on the 19.3 acre campus is expected to top out in April 2024, and be completed in October 2025.The center's work includes digitizing the Barack <b>Obama</b> Presidential Library with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), to create the first fully digitized presidential library. The Library is administered by NARA, which will preserve hardcopies of documents at a separate NARA facility; however, many will be loaned to the Presidential Center for display.The center is located in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago, adjacent to the University of Chicago campus. The university provides planning, support, engagement and programming. Included within the center's plans is a new branch for the Chicago Public Library.Federal review ended in December 2020, with final completion in 2021. Construction began in August 2021. == Board and staff == The <b>Obama</b> Foundation board includes Chairman Marty Nesbitt, a close friend from Chicago; J. Kevin Poorman, president and CEO of PSP Capital Partners; David Plouffe; Obama's half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng; venture capital financier John Doerr; Studio Museum in Harlem Director and Chief Curator Thelma Golden; fundraiser and former White House Social Secretary Julianna Smoot; investment managers John Rogers and Michael Sacks; and former Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick. Barack <b>Obama</b> has a home in Hyde Park. The foundation was formally established in January 2014.Louise Bernard, outgoing Director of Exhibitions at NYPL, was named director of the Museum of the <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center in May 2017. Michael Strautmanis became the vice-president of civic engagement for the foundation in 2016. == Site selection == In 2014 the <b>Obama</b> Foundation released details for institutions interested in being the location of the center.The foundation ultimately received bids from four institutions: Columbia University (New York City) University of Chicago (Chicago) University of Illinois at Chicago (Chicago) University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa (Honolulu)In May 2015 the foundation's board announced it had decided to build the center in partnership with the University of Chicago. <b>Obama</b> taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004.After the foundation's board had selected to build the center in partnership with the University of Chicago they began deciding between two possible locations, Washington Park and Jackson Park. They ultimately selected Jackson Park.In 2018, the <b>Obama</b> Foundation released the proposed bid by the University of Chicago, and the three other universities. The 2014 bid revealed that the University of Chicago included various plans, such as combining the golf courses at South Shore and Jackson Park into a single \u201cworld class facility,\u201d and the closing of Cornell Drive and other streets in the vicinity of Jackson Park in order to improve the connecting green space for museums located in a nearby area known as \"Museum Campus South\". == Planning and design == The University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Hawaii, and Columbia University submitted proposals to host the institution. In May 2015, the Barack <b>Obama</b> Foundation and Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel announced that the foundation and the Barack <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center would be located in Chicago's South Side, and would be built in partnership with the University of Chicago. Both the former president and his wife Michelle <b>Obama</b> stressed the importance of Chicago's South Side as an influence in their own lives. She said, \"One of my greatest honors is being a proud Chicagoan, a daughter of the South Side. I still lead with that descriptor. I wear it boldly and proudly like a crown.\" A design advisory committee assisted in the selection of the architects. Members of the committee included sculptor Don Gummer (the husband of actress Meryl Streep); Ed Schlossberg of ESI Design (husband of Caroline Kennedy, the former U.S. ambassador to Japan); Fred Eychaner, a Chicago radio station owner and Democratic financier; and Architectural Digest magazine editor Margaret Russell. Seven architectural firms were announced as finalists in December 2015 from an initial list of 140 applicants: John Ronan Architects, Adjaye Associates, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Renzo Piano Building Workshop, SHoP Architects, Sn\u00f8hetta, and Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects.In June 2016, the foundation chose New York-based Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects and Chicago-based Interactive Design Architects to jointly lead the design and engineering of the center. For the exhibition design, Ralph Appelbaum Associates, which worked on the National Museum of African American History, will lead a team including Civic Projects, Normal, and several local artists. The landscape architect is Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, with Site Design Group, and Living Habitats. Lakeside Alliance, which includes Turner Construction and a consortium of local African-American owned firms: Powers & Sons Construction, UJAMAA Construction, Brown & Momen, Safeway Construction, and Kates Security Services will build the center.Two parks near the University of Chicago's campus, Jackson Park and Washington Park, were considered. On July 29, 2016, the foundation announced the selection of portion of Jackson Park in the Woodlawn neighborhood. Jackson Park, designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, already houses the Museum of Science and Industry and a golf course.Preliminary plans were unveiled in May 2017, involving three buildings in geometric shapes covered in light-colored stone, roughly 200,000 to 225,000 square feet (18,600 to 20,900 m2). The museum building (which will also include educational and meeting space) will be the tallest at 180 ft (55 m). The other buildings, a library building and a forum building, will be a single story. The latter building will feature an auditorium, a restaurant, and a public garden. In 2018, the center announced an agreement to place a Chicago Public Library branch within the complex.The unveiled plan incorporates the Jackson Park end of Midway Plaisance from the north (which would be readapted as a circular green space surrounding a water basin), and the entirety of the park's hockey field and adjoining parkland to the south, where the main buildings and new park landscaping are to be sited. As part of a wider plan to reclaim parkland and improve park safety, the project also necessitates the closure, between 60th and 67th streets, of South Cornell Drive, a 6-lane thoroughfare that runs along the western park lagoon and the park's golf course from Midway Plaisance to South Shore. Without improvements to other roadways that will accommodate local traffic, these closures will result in nine intersections in the area to operate over capacity causing substantial traffic delays. These infrastructure changes would not be paid for by the <b>Obama</b> Foundation, and would require government funding, expected to cost the city $175 million. == Local reaction == === Community Benefits Agreement === The <b>Obama</b> Library South Side Community Benefits Agreement Coalition, a coalition of 19 community and activist groups, is seeking a community benefits agreement to require that the <b>Obama</b> Foundation, in partnership with the City of Chicago, set aside jobs for residents in the local communities, protect low-income housing and home owners, support and create Black businesses, and strengthen neighborhood schools. Some residents have concerns about rising property taxes and rents that could displace many of the low-income Black residents. Recent rent increases for residents living directly across from the site escalated concerns of displacement of residents, particularly those who have fixed incomes, and has drawn protests against local Aldermen who are in opposition of a community benefits agreement. As of 2018, the <b>Obama</b> Foundation has so far refused to consider a community benefits agreement.The foundation has announced plans for community hiring. An economic impact assessment estimates that about 28% of the 4,945 short-term construction jobs would go to South Side residents, with the remainder to the rest of Cook County. About 2,175 of the 2,536 long-term jobs would to go South Side residents, with the remainder to residents in rest of Cook County. It is estimated that the long-term jobs will bring in about $104 million in annual income to Cook County residents, or about $41,000 per job.In July 2019, local aldermen Jeanette Taylor and Leslie Hairston introduced an ordinance aimed at protecting affordable housing near the development. The ordinance would require 30% of new units built in a 2-mile radius of the development to be affordable and offer right of first refusal for nearby tenants, among other benefits. The ordinance earned support from nearly 30 aldermen in Chicago City Council. In January 2020, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration announced that it would support a scaled-back version of a Community Benefits Agreement ordinance, but Taylor re-iterated support for the original ordinance.In July 2020, the Lightfoot administration and aldermen Taylor agreed on a compromise ordinance that went further than the administration's earlier proposal. The compromise ordinance would require that 30% of units on 52 city-owned lots in Woodlawn be reserved for residents making between 30% and 50% of the Area Median Income, that any building refinanced through the Preservation of Existing Affordable Rentals program must reserve 10% of units for those making less than 30% of the AMI and 10% for those making less than 50% of the AMI, that the city's Housing Department request $675,000 in federal funds to support a local program to promote homeownership among current residents, and that eligibility restrictions be loosened for Woodlawn's Home Improvement Grant Program. The compromise was reached after negotiations between the administration, aldermen Taylor and Hairston, the CBA Coalition, and other community groups. Taylor called the compromise ordinance a \"step in the right direction\" and, along with members of the CBA coalition, called for further action. === Public land === The nonprofit group Friends of the Parks opposes the loss of parkland to build the center and had threatened a lawsuit to block development. In May 2018, the preservationist group \"Protect Our Parks\" filed a lawsuit, to prevent the part of Jackson Park, which dates from 1893, from being taken from the public and given to a private entity. Mayor Emanuel was critical of the lawsuit. Later that month, the plan to build the center was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission.In early August 2018, the Chicago Park District began cutting trees to relocate park facilities, with the most notable being the Jackson Park athletic field. On September 17, 2018, the Chicago Park District suspended its construction related to the Center following meetings with the National Park Service and the Federal Highway Administration. On September 18, 2018, it was announced that the center will be owned by the city of Chicago once completed and that the <b>Obama</b> Foundation will not receive the tax-based operating or capital support, nor the perpetual leases which the 11 other museums in the city parks obtain.Chicago mayor and former <b>Obama</b> White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel submitted two ordinances to the Chicago City Council on September 20: the first would grant the <b>Obama</b> Foundation a 99-year lease on the Jackson Park site for $10.00 with various restrictions on the foundation's use, in return for the foundation's financial responsibility for maintaining and operating the city-owned project; the second allows the city to plow under Cornell Drive from 59th Street to Hayes Drive in order to reconfigure this area as green space. The Chicago Department of Planning and Development (DPD) ordinance amended a 2015 agreement with the park district concerning the <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center. Under the new ordinance, the Presidential Center will comply with the Museum Act's free admission days requirements. Parking fees for the center will also be regulated so they are consistent with the rates charged at the Museum of Science and Industry or in the North Garage adjacent to the Field Museum. The ordinance will also ensure that these parking fees may solely be used to finance the center's operations, maintenance, management, and endowment funding. On October 31, 2018, the Chicago city council unanimously approved the new proposals for the <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center. Mayor Emanuel afterwards read a letter of thanks written by former President Obama.On October 24, 2018, U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey held a status conference in the lawsuit filed by the group Protect Our Parks to prevent construction in Jackson Park. Blakey indicated that both sides want a quick resolution and the court will not delay the lawsuit. The city informed the court that they intend to seek a motion to dismiss after action by the City Council. Discovery continued during the next few months. On November 23, 2018, a motion was filed by the city of Chicago to dismiss the Protect Our Parks lawsuit. This request was denied on February 19, 2019, by Judge Blakey, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. On June 11, 2019, Judge Blakey ruled on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and granted judgment in favor of the City and against Protect our Parks, dismissing the lawsuit to block construction of the <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center in Jackson Park. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2021, which denied the requested injunction against the City. === Other reactions === Some University of Chicago faculty members signed a letter stating concerns about the design, raised questions about the estimated cost of transportation improvements, and stated that the plan is an \"object-lesson in the mistakes of the past\". A counter-letter in support of the <b>Obama</b> Center was signed by other faculty in response. The independent campus student newspaper, The Chicago Maroon wrote an editorial in support of the center that criticized the concerns raised by some faculty. == Construction and fundraising == Construction of the center was originally expected to begin in late 2018 and be completed in 2020 or 2021. A federal review of the project began in late 2017, responding to the local criticism and attempting to assess whether the project affects Jackson Park's status on the National Register of Historic Places. This review will likely determine the start date of construction if the plan is approved. Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects released the concept design for the center in 2017. The architects said in February 2017 that construction of the center's museum and library would likely approach $300 million, and that the center would likely need an endowment of $1.5 billion. In 2017, <b>Obama</b> reportedly was set to engage in a major fundraising effort for the center. On July 27, 2018, the <b>Obama</b> Foundation announced that groundbreaking for the center would be delayed until sometime in 2019, and the center would not open in 2021, as was initially planned.The foundation's 2017 annual report, and its 2017 IRS filing, show that the <b>Obama</b> Foundation raised $232.6 million, on expenses of $23 million. The year after <b>Obama</b> left office was the first year the foundation lifted a cap on donations. While it lists its donors on its website, it no longer specifically links donors to exact amounts. While the Chicago city government has not promised that the foundation's endowment details will be disclosed publicly, its agreement with the foundation requires that the foundation may not proceed with construction of the center until the building endowment is secured. On June 3, 2019, it was announced that a $5 million grant had been issued to the city of Chicago by the MacArthur Foundation for plans to build the new Chicago Public Library branch at the site of the proposed <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center. Construction began in August 2021. On September 28, 2021, the Obamas, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Lightfoot participated in the groundbreaking ceremony.In November 2022, construction of the library was temporarily halted for several days, after a noose was found on site. === <b>Obama</b> presidential documents and artifacts === The papers and artifacts from the <b>Obama</b> administration are being stored and processed inside a secure facility located at 2500 W. Golf Rd in suburban Hoffman Estates, northwest of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The records are to be digitized and stored in existing NARA facilities. By law, they are subject to Freedom of Information Act requests beginning in 2022. == Federal review == The federal government began a review of this project in 2017 because of Jackson Park's historic designation and potential changes to the roadways in and around the park. The review concluded four years later in 2021, and some design changes were made to meet objections raised in the review.In May 2018, the City of Chicago agreed to lease the land, 19.3 acres, to the OPC for 99 years. Once the construction is completed, the City of Chicago will own the center, per that 2018 city council agreement, reported in 2021 and also in 2018. The present mayor of Chicago has concerns for homeowners in the area, leading the City Council to agree to spend funds to keep people in their homes or aid them in buying other homes.Concerns about gentrification of the neighborhood around the OPC and Jackson Park led to an agreement in August 2020 regarding home improvement funds for homes in Woodlawn. \"In July, city officials negotiated a deal that will require developers to include affordable housing for projects on city-owned property in Woodlawn. The agreement, worked out with residents and the local alderman, will also provide up to $20,000 in funding for home improvement work to some homeowners.\"Those who favor this project see it as a huge investment in the South Side, with the new public library branch, as well as the <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center itself, immediate benefits in jobs and when the project is completed it is expected to be a draw for tourists as well as an asset to the people in the neighborhood. They anticipate construction beginning in August 2021. Opponents appealed the plans, but lost in a federal court. They then appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in August 2021 refused to block the construction. Site construction began in August and a formal groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 28, 2021. == See also == Presidential Records Act == References == == External links == Barack <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center Barack <b>Obama</b> Presidential Library Builder website for the <b>Obama</b> Center", "summary": "The Barack <b>Obama</b> Presidential Center is a planned museum, library and education project in Chicago to commemorate the presidency of Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States.

The oldest child of President Joe <b>Biden</b> and Neilia Hunter Biden, he served as the 44th attorney general of Delaware from 2007 to 2015 and was a major in the Delaware Army National Guard in the Iraq War. He died of glioblastoma in 2015 at the age of 46. == Early life and family == Joseph Robinette \"Beau\" <b>Biden</b> III was born in Wilmington, Delaware, on February 3, 1969. He was the first son of Joe <b>Biden</b> (who would become a U.S. senator, vice president, and president), and his first wife Neilia. On December 18, 1972, Beau's mother and infant sister Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping. Beau was just under four years old, and his brother, Hunter, was just under three years old. Beau and Hunter were in the car when the crash took place and were critically injured but survived. Beau sustained multiple broken bones, while Hunter sustained injuries to his skull and severe traumatic brain damage. They spent several months in the hospital, where their father was sworn into the Senate two weeks after the accident.According to some accounts, Beau and Hunter encouraged their father to marry again, even going so far as to ask him \"when were 'we' going to get married\". In June 1977, his father married Jill Jacobs, whom Beau welcomed as a stepmother. His half-sister, Ashley, was born in 1981.Beau <b>Biden</b> married Hallie Olivere in 2002. They had two children: daughter Natalie Naomi (b. 2004), and son Robert Hunter II (b. 2006). == Career == <b>Biden</b> graduated from Archmere Academy, his father's high school alma mater, and the University of Pennsylvania in 1991, where he was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. He was also a graduate of Syracuse University College of Law, as was his father. After graduating from law school, he clerked for Judge Steven McAuliffe of the United States District Court of New Hampshire. From 1995 to 2004, he worked at the United States Department of Justice in Philadelphia, first as Counsel to the Office of Policy Development and later as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office.Biden was in Kosovo after the 1998-1999 Kosovo War, working on behalf of the OSCE to train judges and prosecutors for the local judicial system. In 2004 he became a partner in the law firm of Bifferato, Gentilotti, <b>Biden</b> & Balick, where he worked for two years before being elected Attorney General of Delaware.When Joe <b>Biden</b> was nominated for vice president at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Beau introduced him. Many delegates wept at his speech, which recounted the auto accident that killed his mother and sister and the subsequent commitment his father made to his sons. == Military service == <b>Biden</b> joined the Delaware Army National Guard in 2003 and attended The JAG School at the University of Virginia. He attained the rank of major in the Judge Advocate General's Corps as part of the 261st Signal Brigade in Smyrna, Delaware.Biden's unit was activated to deploy to Iraq on October 3, 2008, and sent to Fort Bliss, Texas for pre-deployment training. This was the day after his father participated in the 2008 presidential campaign's only vice presidential debate. His father was on the record as saying, \"I don't want him going. But I tell you what, I don't want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years, and so how we leave makes a big difference.\"Biden traveled to Washington, D.C. from Iraq in January 2009 for the presidential inauguration and his father's swearing-in as vice president, then returned to Iraq. <b>Biden</b> received a visit at Camp Victory from his father on July 4, 2009.Biden returned from Iraq in September 2009 after completing his yearlong stint on active duty which included a 7-month deployment in the combat zone with the Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps. During his deployment he announced that he would continue to actively serve as Delaware's attorney general by working in conjunction with his office's senior staff in Delaware, although a member of his unit related that <b>Biden</b> said he had turned over most of his attorney general work to his chief deputy in order to focus on his duties in Iraq.Biden was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his service in Iraq. Army Chief of Staff Raymond Odierno delivered the eulogy at Biden's funeral and presented a posthumous Legion of Merit for his service in the Delaware National Guard, stating \"Beau <b>Biden</b> possessed the traits I have witnessed in only the greatest leaders.\" He was also posthumously presented with the Delaware Conspicuous Service Cross, which is \"awarded for heroism, meritorious service and outstanding achievement\". == Political career == In his first bid for political office, <b>Biden</b> ran for attorney general of Delaware in 2006. Biden's opponent was a veteran state prosecutor and assistant U.S. attorney, Ferris Wharton. Major issues in the campaign included the candidates' experience and proposed efforts to address sex offenders, Internet predators, senior abuse and domestic abuse. <b>Biden</b> won the election by approximately five percentage points.After being elected, he appointed former Delaware Attorney General and International Judge Richard S. Gebelein as Chief Deputy Attorney General, and former assistant U.S. Attorney Richard G. Andrews was appointed as State Prosecutor. As Attorney General, <b>Biden</b> supported and enforced stronger registration requirements for sex offenders.Joe <b>Biden</b> resigned from the Senate following his 2008 election to the vice presidency. Governor Ruth Ann Minner named former Joe <b>Biden</b> aide Ted Kaufman to fill the vacant seat, but Kaufman made it clear that he would not be a candidate in the 2010 special election. It fueled speculation Beau would run at that time. Biden's father stated after the announcement of Kaufman's appointment, \"It is no secret that I believe my son, Attorney General, would make a great United States Senator just as I believe he has been a great attorney general. But Beau has made it clear from the moment he entered public life that any office he sought he would earn on his own.... [I]f he chooses to run for the Senate in the future, he will have to run and win on his own. He wouldn't have it any other way.\" In October 2009, <b>Biden</b> stated that he was considering a run for the Senate and that he would make a final decision in January. On January 25, <b>Biden</b> confirmed that he would forgo a Senate run so as to better focus on the prosecution of Earl Bradley, a convicted serial child rapist.On November 2, 2010, he was easily re-elected to a second term as Delaware Attorney General, beating Independent Party of Delaware candidate Doug Campbell by a large margin.Biden was criticized for his handling of the prosecution of Robert H. Richards IV, an heir of the powerful Delaware-based Du Pont family accused of sexually assaulting his young daughter. In 2008, Biden's office charged Richards with two counts of second-degree rape, charges punishable by a minimum of 20 years in prison, but later that year, his office entered a plea bargain with Richards in which Richards pleaded guilty to one count of fourth-degree rape and was sentenced by Judge Jan Jurden to eight years' probation. Defending the plea bargain and Jurden's sentencing in a letter to The News Journal, <b>Biden</b> wrote \"This was not a strong case, and a loss at trial was a distinct possibility\" and said the judge \"exercised sound discretion\".Biden did not seek election to a third term as attorney general in 2014. In the spring of that year, he announced his intention to run for governor of Delaware in the 2016 election to succeed term-limited Democratic Governor Jack Markell. At the time of this announcement, the cancer that would kill <b>Biden</b> in 2015 had been diagnosed (in 2013), but was in remission. == Illness and death == According to his father, Beau was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis in 2001 after returning from service in Kosovo. He was later diagnosed with brain cancer, which his father believes was possibly a consequence of exposure to military burn pits in Iraq.For the final few years of his life, <b>Biden</b> suffered from a brain tumor. In May 2010, he was admitted to Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, after complaining of a headache, numbness, and paralysis. Officials stated that he had suffered a mild stroke. Later that month, <b>Biden</b> was transferred to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia and kept for observation for several days.In August 2013, <b>Biden</b> was admitted to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive type of brain cancer, after experiencing what White House officials called \"an episode of disorientation and weakness\". A lesion was removed at that time. <b>Biden</b> had radiation and chemotherapy treatments and the cancer remained stable. On May 20, 2015, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, because of a recurrence of brain cancer. He died there ten days later, on May 30, 2015, at the age of 46. His funeral was held at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church in Wilmington, Delaware, on June 6, 2015. Biden's funeral was attended by then President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, their daughters Malia and Sasha, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State and former First Lady Hillary Clinton, former US Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno, and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. At his funeral, he was awarded the Legion of Merit Award by General Odierno, for his services in the Iraq War. President <b>Obama</b> described <b>Biden</b> as \"an original. He was a good man. He did in 46 years what most of us couldn't do in 146.\" At his funeral service, a solo rendition of the song \"Til Kingdom Come\" was performed by Chris Martin, the lead singer of the band Coldplay, of whom Beau had been a fan.Beau <b>Biden</b> was buried at St. Joseph on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware. His gravesite is near the graves of his grandparents Joe Sr. and Catherine, his mother Neilia and his sister Naomi. == Posthumous awards and legacy == On November 4, 2015, <b>Biden</b> was posthumously awarded the Albert Schweitzer Leadership Award, the highest honor given by the Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation (HOBY), for his service to mankind. A portion of the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) was named the \"Beau <b>Biden</b> Cancer Moonshot\" initiative after him. A named scholarship was established at Syracuse University College of Law in 2016.In August 2016, Joe Biden, his sister Valerie <b>Biden</b> Owens and son Hunter attended a ceremony that renamed a southeastern Kosovar highway \"Joseph R. 'Beau' Biden, III\" to honor Beau's contribution to Kosovo for training its judges and prosecutors. That year the Major Joseph R. \"Beau\" <b>Biden</b> III National Guard/Reserve Center in New Castle, Delaware was named in his honor. On November 14, 2017, Joe <b>Biden</b> published a memoir titled Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose, where he reflects on Beau Biden's illness and death. On March 2, 2020, Joe <b>Biden</b> mentioned Beau in a speech, comparing him to former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg after Buttigieg endorsed <b>Biden</b> for the 2020 presidential election:I don't think I've ever done this before, but [Buttigieg] reminds me of my son, Beau, and I know that may not mean much to most people, but to me, it's the highest compliment I can give any man or woman.The Major Joseph R. \"Beau\" <b>Biden</b> III National Guard/Reserve Center, named for Biden, is in New Castle, Delaware; it was the site of a speech by Joe <b>Biden</b> the day before his inauguration where he stated \"we should be introducing him (Beau) as president\".In 2020, his brother, Robert Hunter Biden, named his newborn son \u2013 Joseph Robinette <b>Biden</b> IV \u2013 after his brother, with the son also using \"Beau\" as his nickname.On January 20, 2021, the day his father was sworn in as president, the band New Radicals reunited for the first time in 22 years to perform their 1998 hit song \"You Get What You Give\" during an inauguration performance. The song was a favorite of Beau's and at his 2015 funeral his sister Ashley recited the lyrics in her eulogy. The band had rejected offers to perform over the past 22 years but wanted to honor this day and honor Beau. \"We pledged if Joe [Biden] won, we\u2019d get together and play our little song both in memory and in honor of our new president\u2019s patriot son Beau and also with the prayer of Joe being able to bring our country together again with compassion, honesty and justice for a change,\u201d singer Gregg Alexander said prior to their performance. == References == == External links == Appearances on C-SPAN Beau <b>Biden</b> at Find a Grave \"Beau <b>Biden</b> memorial page\".

Biden, a Democrat from Delaware who previously served as vice president under Barack Obama, took office following his victory in the 2020 presidential election over Republican incumbent president Donald Trump. Upon his inauguration, he became the oldest president in American history, breaking the record set by his predecessor Trump. <b>Biden</b> entered office amid the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic crisis, and increased political polarization.On the first day of his presidency, <b>Biden</b> made an effort to revert President Trump's energy policy by restoring U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement and revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. He also halted funding for Trump's border wall, an expansion of the Mexican border wall. On his second day, he issued a series of executive orders to reduce the impact of COVID-19, including invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, and set an early goal of achieving one hundred million COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in his first 100 days.Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021; a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that temporarily established expanded unemployment insurance and sent $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans in response to continued economic pressure from COVID-19. He signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act; a ten-year plan brokered by <b>Biden</b> alongside Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to invest in American roads, bridges, public transit, ports and broadband access. <b>Biden</b> signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, making Juneteenth a federal holiday in the United States. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2014the first Black woman to serve on the court. After The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, <b>Biden</b> took executive actions, such as the signing of Executive Order 14076, to preserve and protect women's health rights nationwide, against abortion bans in Republican led states. <b>Biden</b> proposed a significant expansion of the U.S. social safety net through the Build Back Better Act, but those efforts, along with voting rights legislation, failed in Congress. However, in August 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a domestic appropriations bill that included some of the provisions of the Build Back Better Act after the entire bill failed to pass. It included significant federal investment in climate and domestic clean energy production, tax credits for solar panels, electric cars and other home energy programs as well as a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. <b>Biden</b> signed the CHIPS and Science Act, bolstering the semiconductor and manufacturing industry, the Honoring our PACT Act, expanding healthcare for US veterans, and the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act. In late 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and codified same-sex and interracial marriage in the United States. In response to the debt-ceiling crisis of 2023, <b>Biden</b> negotiated and signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which restrains federal spending for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, implements minor changes to SNAP and TANF, includes energy permitting reform, claws back some IRS funding and unspent money for COVID-19, and suspends the debt ceiling to January 1, 2025. <b>Biden</b> established the American Climate Corps and created the first ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. On September 26, 2023, Joe <b>Biden</b> visited a United Auto Workers picket line during the 2023 United Auto Workers strike, making him the first US president to visit one. The foreign policy goal of the <b>Biden</b> administration is to restore the US to a \"position of trusted leadership\" among global democracies in order to address the challenges posed by Russia and China. In foreign policy, <b>Biden</b> completed the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan, declaring an end to nation-building efforts and shifting U.S. foreign policy toward strategic competition with China and, to a lesser extent, Russia. However, during the withdrawal, the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control, leading to <b>Biden</b> receiving bipartisan criticism. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia as well as providing Ukraine with over $100 billion in combined military, economic, and humanitarian aid. <b>Biden</b> also approved a raid which led to the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the leader of the Islamic State, and approved a drone strike which killed Ayman Al Zawahiri, leader of Al-Qaeda. <b>Biden</b> signed AUKUS, an international security alliance, together with Australia and the United Kingdom. <b>Biden</b> called for the expansion of NATO with the addition of Finland and Sweden, and rallied NATO allies in support of Ukraine. During the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war, <b>Biden</b> condemned Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism and announced American military support for Israel; <b>Biden</b> also showed his support and sympathy towards Palestinians affected by the war, sent humanitarian aid, and brokered a four-day ceasefire. <b>Biden</b> began his term with over 50% approval ratings; however, these fell significantly after the withdrawal from Afghanistan and remained low as the country experienced high inflation and rising gas prices. His age and mental fitness have also been a subject of discussion. == 2020 election == <b>Biden</b> announced his candidacy in April 2019, having previously sought the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008, being unsuccessful both times.On November 7, four days after Election Day, <b>Biden</b> was projected to have defeated the incumbent president Donald Trump, becoming president-elect of the United States with 306 of the total 538 electoral votes, and 81,268,924 popular votes versus 74,216,154 votes for Trump. The Trump campaign launched at least 63 lawsuits against the results, especially in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada and Michigan, raising unevidenced claims of widespread voter fraud that were subsequently dismissed by courts. == Transition period, inauguration, and first 100 days == Though <b>Biden</b> was generally acknowledged as the winner, General Services Administration head Emily W. Murphy initially refused to begin the transition to the president-elect, thereby denying funds and office space to his team. On November 23, after Michigan certified its results, Murphy issued the letter of ascertainment, granting the <b>Biden</b> transition team access to federal funds and resources for an orderly transition.Two days after becoming the projected winner of the 2020 election, <b>Biden</b> announced the formation of a task force to advise him on the COVID-19 pandemic during the transition, co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former FDA commissioner David A. Kessler, and Yale University's Marcella Nunez-Smith.On January 5, 2021, the Democratic Party won control of the United States Senate, effective January 20, as a result of electoral victories in Georgia by Jon Ossoff in a runoff election for a six-year term and Raphael Warnock in a special runoff election for a two-year term. President-elect <b>Biden</b> had supported and campaigned for both candidates prior to the runoff elections on January 5.On January 6, a mob of thousands of Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol in the hope of overturning Biden's election, forcing Congress to evacuate during the counting of the Electoral College votes. More than 26,000 National Guard members were deployed to the capital for the inauguration, with thousands remaining into the spring. On January 20, 2021, <b>Biden</b> was sworn in by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts as the 46th president of the United States, completing the oath of office at 11:49 am EST, eleven minutes before the legal start of his term. === Inaugural address === Biden's inaugural speech laid out his vision to unite the nation, prefaced by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic strife, climate change, political polarization, and racial injustice. <b>Biden</b> called for an end to the \"uncivil war\" of political, demographic, and ideological American cultures through a greater embrace of diversity. He cited the American Civil War, Great Depression, world wars, and September 11 attacks as moments in American history where citizens' \"better angels\" prevailed, saying that the unity, the solution, must again be invoked to rise from the \"cascading\" crises of the present; this unity, he proclaimed, exists in the \"common objects\" that define America: \"opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and ... truth.\" He explicitly decried white supremacy and nativism, calling them an \"ugly reality\" of American life he vows to defeat that clouds the \"American ideal\" set out in the U.S. Declaration of Independence \u2014 that all Americans are equal. <b>Biden</b> pledged that the U.S. would \"engage with the world once again\", \"repair our alliances\", and act as a \"trusted partner for peace and security\". Near the conclusion of his speech, <b>Biden</b> held a moment of silence for those who died in the COVID-19 pandemic. Quoting the Gene Scheer composition \"American Anthem\", he implored Americans to consider their legacy in answering the \"call of history\" to protect \"democracy, hope, truth, and justice\", \"secure liberty\", and make America a \"beacon to the world\", insisting that generations of their descendants would judge them on their actions. The full text of Joe Biden's Inaugural Address at Wikisource. == Administration == <b>Biden</b> was inaugurated alongside Kamala Harris, the first woman, first African American, and first Asian American vice president.On November 11, 2020, <b>Biden</b> selected Ron Klain, who served as his vice presidential chief of staff, to serve as his White House Chief of Staff. <b>Biden</b> chose Jen Psaki, deputy White House press secretary and U.S. Department of State spokesperson during the presidency of Barack Obama, as his White House press secretary. Psaki announced, and has held, daily press briefings for White House reporters. On March 25, 2021, <b>Biden</b> held his first solo press conference after 64 days in office, unlike his most recent predecessors (back to Herbert Hoover in 1929), who all held their first solo press conferences within 33 days of taking office.On November 17, 2020, <b>Biden</b> announced that he had selected Mike Donilon as senior advisor and Steve Ricchetti as counselor. Jen O'Malley Dillon, who had served as campaign manager for Biden's successful presidential campaign, was named as deputy chief of staff. === Cabinet === <b>Biden</b> selected Antony Blinken to be secretary of state, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as ambassador to the United Nations, and Jake Sullivan as national security advisor.On November 23, 2020, <b>Biden</b> announced Alejandro Mayorkas to be his choice for Secretary of Homeland Security and Avril Haines as Director of National Intelligence. Throughout December and January, <b>Biden</b> continued to select cabinet members, including Marty Walsh, the then current mayor of Boston, as his Secretary of Labor.Biden altered his cabinet structure, elevating the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and ambassador to the United Nations as cabinet-level positions. <b>Biden</b> removed the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from his official cabinet at the onset of his presidency, but he restored it to the cabinet in 2023.While administering the oath of office to hundreds of White House officials through video conferencing, <b>Biden</b> called for more civility in politics, saying: \"If you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot. ... No ifs, ands, or buts.\" == Judicial appointments == === United States Supreme Court nominations === == Domestic affairs == === Health care === <b>Biden</b> strongly campaigned for the presidency on the public option, a policy that, if enacted into law, would have offered Americans a choice between maintaining their private healthcare insurance or buying into Medicare. The idea was viewed as a compromise between the progressive and moderate flanks of the Democratic Party. The <b>Biden</b> campaign described the public option as a \"plan to protect and build on ObamaCare\".However, shortly before taking office in January 2021, Biden's team abruptly dropped the proposal, frustrating many online progressives who already viewed the public option healthcare proposal as a failure to fight the status quo.The <b>Biden</b> administration rescinded work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The administration opened a special enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act as well as extending the normal enrollment period, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. The administration provided larger premium subsidies.In August 2022, President <b>Biden</b> signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The law allocates $64 billion for a three-year expansion of Affordable Care Act subsidies originally expanded under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and $265 billion for prescription drug price reform to lower prices, including providing Medicare the authority to negotiate the prices for certain drugs. That same month, <b>Biden</b> signed into law the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, which expands federal health care access, services, and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during their service, including toxic smoke from burn pits. ==== COVID-19 pandemic ==== On January 20, 2021, his first day as president, <b>Biden</b> implemented a federal mask mandate, requiring the use of masks and social distancing in all federal buildings, on federal lands, and by federal employees and contractors. <b>Biden</b> also signed an executive order that reversed the withdrawal of the U.S. from the World Health Organization (WHO), making Dr. Anthony Fauci the head of the delegation to the WHO. On January 21, the administration released a 200-page document titled \"National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness\". On his second day in office, <b>Biden</b> invoked the Defense Production Act to speed up the vaccination process and ensure the availability of glass vials, syringes, and other vaccine supplies at the federal level. In justifying his use of the act, <b>Biden</b> said: \"And when I say wartime, people kind of look at me like 'wartime?' Well, as I said last night, 400,000 Americans have died. That's more than have died in all of World War II. 400,000. This is a wartime undertaking.\" <b>Biden</b> established the White House COVID-19 Response Team, a White House Office dedicated to coordinating a unified federal government response.On January 21, 2021, <b>Biden</b> signed ten executive orders pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to meet his vaccination goal of a hundred million shots in his first 100 days in office, <b>Biden</b> signed an executive order increasing needed supplies. <b>Biden</b> signed an order on January 21 that directed FEMA to offer full reimbursements to states for the cost of using their own National Guard personnel and emergency supplies such as Personal Protective Equipment in schools. On January 24, 2021, <b>Biden</b> reinstated a travel ban imposed by President Trump on Brazil, United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, and 26 other European countries. The travel ban prevents non-U.S. citizens living in the prospective countries from entering the U.S. <b>Biden</b> implemented a face mask requirement on nearly all forms of public transportation and inside of transportation hubs; previously, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had recommended that such a policy be enacted but it was blocked by the Trump administration, under which the CDC issued strong, albeit non-binding recommendations for mask use in these settings.In mid-March 2021, <b>Biden</b> dismissed a request by the European Union to export unused COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca out of the U.S. even though the manufacturer endorsed it and vowed to resupply the doses. The rationale for this decision, which contributed to low European vaccination rates, was that the U.S. had to be \"over-supplied and over-prepared\", according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Whereas the U.S. exported no vaccines, the European Union exported 77 million doses to the world from December 2020 to March 2021. Eventually, the U.S. reversed course and gave vaccine doses from AstraZeneca to Mexico, Canada, and Japan by the end of March.On May 6, 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration announced that it supports waiving patent protections on existing COVID-19 vaccines so that other countries can produce generic variants, following weeks of pressure from the international community. On 7 May, French president Emmanuel Macron called on the U.S. \"to put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production.\"On May 26, 2021, <b>Biden</b> ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to increase their investigations into the origin of the virus, following reports that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology became ill a month before the pandemic began.In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, <b>Biden</b> said that the U.S. has \"a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated, touting the vaccines' effectiveness against hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. He also criticized the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, saying it was \"killing people\".Despite months of vaccine availability and incentives, by September many Americans continued to resist vaccination amid rising cases in several states, hampering prospects towards herd immunity. On September 9, <b>Biden</b> stated, \"We've been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us.\" That day he issued an executive order directing businesses with more than 100 employees to require vaccination of their workers or weekly testing, affecting about 80 million Americans. The order also required the roughly 17 million employees of health facilities receiving federal Medicare or Medicaid to be vaccinated. Many Republicans asserted Biden's order was an unconstitutional overreach of federal authority, and some Republican governors said they would sue to block it.The <b>Biden</b> administration responded to the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in December 2021 by advocating for a state-level response over a federal level response. Throughout the surge, the <b>Biden</b> administration has been criticized for a lack of COVID-19 tests, exacerbating the spread of the Omicron variant. When questioned about the apparent shortage of tests, Jen Psaki replied, \"Should we just send one to every American? Then what happens if every American has one test? How much does that cost and what happens after that?\", causing backlash. The <b>Biden</b> administration responded by promising an increased supply of at-home tests later in 2022.In the midst of an all-time high of new COVID-19 cases, the Centers for Disease Control revised their guidelines, recommending five days of quarantine rather than ten without requiring a negative COVID-19 test. This move was criticized by health experts who worry that without rapid testing, COVID-positive people may unknowingly spread COVID-19 in workplaces under the recommended CDC guidelines. Others criticize the CDC for implementing this change following lobbying by Delta Airlines, leading to social media backlash against the federal government. ==== Cancer research ==== <b>Biden</b> gave a speech at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on September 12, 2022, the 60th anniversary of Kennedy's We Choose to Go to the Moon speech, promoting his administration's revival of the Beau <b>Biden</b> Cancer Moonshot, including the new Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. === Economy === On January 22, 2021, <b>Biden</b> signed an executive order that removed schedule F, overturning a number of Trump's policies that limited the collective bargaining power of federal unions. Biden's executive order also promotes a $15 minimum wage for federal workers and repeals three of Trump's executive orders which made the employee discipline process stricter and restricted union representatives' access to office space. As well as promoting a $15 minimum wage, Biden's executive order increases the amount of money going to the families of children who are missing meals because of school closures due to the pandemic by 15%. The repealing of Trump's three executive orders comes as the orders were used to transfer civil servants and career scientists and replace them with employees friendly to the Trump administration. ==== Build Back Better Plan ==== ===== American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 ===== On January 14, 2021, <b>Biden</b> revealed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The plan includes $1 trillion in direct aid, including $1,400 per-person checks, for working Americans, and would provide for direct housing and nutrition assistance, expanding access to safe and reliable childcare and affordable healthcare, increasing the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance, and giving families with kids and childless workers an emergency boost this year. It would also expand the eligibility of these checks to adult dependents who have been left out of previous rounds of relief. The plan additionally includes $440 billion in community support, providing $350 billion of community support to first responders while the rest goes to grants for small businesses and transit agencies; $400 billion for a national vaccination plan and school reopenings; and $10 billion for information technology, modernizing federal cybersecurity infrastructure. In her first press briefing, press secretary Psaki said the plan was likely to change.The plan invokes the Defense Production Act of 1950 to ensure the production of personal protective equipment, glass vials, syringes, and other supplies exceeds the demand. It allows partners of states to create vaccine centers in stadiums, convention centers and pharmacies. The federal government would identify communities that have been hit hardest by COVID-19, and ensure the vaccine does not reach them at an unfair pace. In addition, the plan would launch a national campaign to educate Americans about the vaccine and COVID-19, targeting misinformation related to the pandemic. Vaccines would also be freely available to all citizens regardless of immigration status. In Biden's plan, he would issue a national testing strategy that attempts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by increasing laboratory capacity and expanding testing. The plan would also develop new treatments for COVID-19.No Republican in Congress voted for the American Rescue Plan. While debates and negotiations over the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 were ongoing, some Republicans, including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, Donald Trump Jr., and Rep. Madison Cawthorn, focused instead on the decision by the Dr. Seuss estate to stop publishing what many viewed as a racially-offensive Dr. Seuss book and the re-branding of the \"Mr. Potato Head\" toy. <b>Biden</b> signed the Plan into law on March 11, 2021. The provision to increase the minimum wage was excluded from the relief plan. ===== American Families Plan ===== On 28 April, during Biden's speech to Congress he unveiled the American Families Plan, a roughly $1.8 trillion proposal to significantly increase federal spending in areas related to childcare, paid leave, pre-kindergarten, community college, and healthcare. It is considered to be the third part of Biden's \"Build Back Better\" agenda (the first being the American Rescue Plan and the second being the American Jobs Plan). The bill was effectively merged with climate change and other provisions that didn't make it into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, for a total $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act. However, the bill did not have Republican support, and Democrats struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion. After the bill ultimately failed to match his envisioned cost, Manchin publicly rejected it, dooming its passage. ==== Labor ==== On inauguration day 2021, <b>Biden</b> fired pro-business Peter Robb, then general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, replacing him with pro-union Jennifer Abruzzo in February 2021. Biden's NLRB has pursued action against Starbucks' and Amazon's alleged anti-union activities. On August 24, 2023, the NLRB reinstated Obama-era policies regarding union elections, speeding up the timeline by removing restrictions such as resolving litigation before holding an election.In late 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed a bill forcing an agreement between union workers and rail companies in order to prevent a strike, earning him criticism from progressives and rail workers. Afterwards, <b>Biden</b> pressured the rail companies to offer paid sick leave to workers, which had been a key demand in the original planned strike. More than 60% of rail workers had sick leave agreements in June 2023.On the 2023 United Auto Workers strike, <b>Biden</b> repeated union leader Shawn Fain's motto \"record profits, record contracts\" and expressed support for the workers in negotiations. <b>Biden</b> assigned two White House officials to aid in negotiation efforts, senior adviser Gene Sperling and acting Labor Secretary Julie Su. On September 26, <b>Biden</b> joined striking UAW workers on the picket line in Michigan, becoming the first President to do so.Biden became the first US president to run for election with a unionized campaign staff for his 2024 election run. ==== Banking ==== Following the Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, <b>Biden</b> expressed opposition to a bailout that was borne by taxpayers. He also claimed that the partial roll-back of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank failures. ==== Domestic manufacturing ==== <b>Biden</b> signed an executive order intended to support domestic manufacturers by increasing a federal preference for purchasing goods made wholly or partly in the U.S. Using the broad term \"Made in America laws\", the executive order's stated goal is to strengthen \"all statutes, regulations, rules, and Executive Orders relating to Federal financial assistance awards or Federal procurement, including those that refer to 'Buy America' or 'Buy American.'\"On August 9, 2022, <b>Biden</b> actively promoted and signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act, which authorized $52 billion for domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing. On August 16, 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law, which included provisions to support the domestic production of solar panels, wind turbines, and other infrastructure. Due to incentives from the CHIPS and Science Act, Micron Technology will invest billions in new semiconductor manufacturing in New York. ==== Trade ==== The Wall Street Journal reported that instead of negotiating access to Chinese markets for large American financial-service firms and pharmaceutical companies, the <b>Biden</b> administration may focus on trade policies that boost exports or domestic jobs. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the administration wants a \"worker-centered trade policy\". U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said she planned to aggressively enforce trade rules to combat unfair practices by China.In March 2021, in her first interview since taking office, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai told The Wall Street Journal the U.S. would not lift tariffs on Chinese imports in the near future, despite lobbying efforts from \"free traders\" including former U.S. Secretary of Treasury Hank Paulson and the Business Roundtable, a big-business group in the U.S., that pressed for tariff repeal.In 2021, the U.S. suspended its diplomatic trade engagement with Myanmar following an escalation in violence perpetrated by the Burmese military against anti-coup protesters. ==== Infrastructure ==== As a part of the Build Back Better Plan, the <b>Biden</b> administration aimed for massive spending on the nation's infrastructure on the order of $2 trillion. Several of the physical infrastructure provisions featured in the proposal were included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. <b>Biden</b> signed the Act into law on November 15, 2021.This final version included approximately $1.2 trillion in spending, with $550 billion being newly authorized spending on top of what Congress was planning to authorize regularly. ==== International taxation ==== Finance officials from 130 countries agreed on July 1, 2021, to plans for a new international taxation policy. All the major economies agreed to pass national laws that would require corporations to pay at least 15% income tax in the countries they operate. This new policy would end the practice of locating world headquarters in small countries with very low taxation rates. Governments hope to recoup some of the lost revenue, estimated at $100 billion to $240 billion each year. The new system was promoted by the <b>Biden</b> administration and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Secretary-General Mathias Cormann of the OECD said: \"This historic package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere.\" ==== Inflation ==== During Biden's first year in office, inflation rose to 7.5%, the highest rate in forty years. Many other major global economies also experienced similarly higher inflation. By June 2022, the United States inflation rate had reached 9.1%. <b>Biden</b> stated during his first State of the Union Address on March 1, 2022, that addressing inflation was his \"top priority\", while touting an anti-inflation plan that he said would address ocean shipping costs and prescription drug prices.In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the <b>Biden</b> administration announced a ban on Russian oil and gas imports to the United States, an action that one analyst said risked \"higher oil prices for American consumers\".Biden advocated more domestic production to lower inflation, but at the same time, he designed stringent import stops for Russian energy. As of March 2022, Iran and Venezuela were still barred by sanctions from selling much of their crude oil into the international market. Political analysts fear that such posturing on Russian energy and international sanctions would only lead to a wider conflict. Similarly, wheat prices hit a 14-year high, as food shortage fears rose worldwide. Economists warn that both a reduction in wheat supply from the Ukraine and strict financial sanctions against Russia would lead to a worsening of the global food supply.In August 2022, President <b>Biden</b> signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law. === Energy, environment, and climate === During his first week in office, <b>Biden</b> established the position of White House National Climate Advisor, appointing environmental health and air quality expert Gina McCarthy to the role. <b>Biden</b> also created the position of U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, appointing former Secretary of State John Kerry.On January 20, 2021, <b>Biden</b> signed an executive order rejoining the U.S. to the Paris Agreement. With the U.S. rejoining the agreement, countries responsible for two-thirds of the global greenhouse gas emissions would make pledges of becoming carbon neutral, while without United States it is only half. On the same day, <b>Biden</b> also issued an executive order that cancelled the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, an extension of the Keystone Pipeline. The pipeline was heavily criticized by environmental and Native American activists and groups. This order also directed agencies to review and reverse more than 100 actions made by Trump on the environment.On January 21, 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration issued a 60-day ban on oil and gas leases and permits on federal land and waters. On January 27, 2021, <b>Biden</b> signed a number of executive orders aimed at combating climate change, one of them setting climate change as a key consideration for U.S. national security and foreign policy. In an attempt to encourage U.S. membership to the Kigali Amendment, an international agreement aimed to reduce the production of hydrofluorocarbons, Biden's executive order directed the U.S. Department of State to submit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate. In March 2021, 21 Republican state attorneys general of 21 states sued the <b>Biden</b> administration for revoking the Keystone XL pipeline permit. The suit claims Biden's executive order exceeded his authority.On March 27, 2021, <b>Biden</b> invited more than forty world leaders for a climate summit. The <b>Biden</b> administration supported the Line 3 pipeline, which transports oil from Canada's oil sands region.In May 2021, the EPA rolled back a Trump administration rule that prohibited the EPA from using certain studies. The previous rule, which made it more difficult to use major scientific studies to justify pollution reduction policies, had already been invalidated by a federal court.On June 1, 2021, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland suspended all oil and gas drilling leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, pending further review of their environmental impacts.In January 2021, <b>Biden</b> had issued a 60-day ban on oil and gas leases and permits on federal land and waters. A group of Republican state attorneys general successfully obtained a decision in federal court to lift the moratorium. The <b>Biden</b> administration appealed the decision but agreed to continue with the sales, and in September 2021 held the largest federal gas and oil lease auction in U.S. history, selling leases to extract 1.7 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. The areas that were purchased by oil companies can be expected to produce around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.12 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years. The administration has also proposed another round of gas and oil lease sales in 2022, in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, and other western states. In November 2021, a closely watched Interior Department report on federal oil and gas lease policy, ordered by Biden, was completed. The report recommended increasing the 12.5% federal royalty rate for oil and gas drilling, which had not been raised by a century, and was significantly lower than rates charged for leasing on state and private land. The report also recommended an increase in the bond rates that drilling companies are required to pay for future cleanup efforts before beginning extraction at new sites, and recommended that leases be focused on sites with \"moderate to high potential\" for production in proximity to existing fossil-fuel infrastructure. The report stopped short of banning the leasing program, which generates billions of dollars for the federal government, but reformed its terms to be less favorable for industry; environmental groups praised the reforms, but also said they were insufficient to address the U.S. contribution to the climate crisis.In 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration proposed a 20-year ban on oil and gas drilling around Chaco Culture National Historical Park, a site in northwestern New Mexico that contain important Ancestral Puebloan sites.The <b>Biden</b> administration set a goal of achieving 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy generated in the U.S. by 2030 (sufficient to provide electricity to about 10 million homes). In 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration approved the South Fork Wind project, a major (130 MW, 12-turbine) commercial offshore wind power project located southeast of Rhode Island's Block Island and east of New York's Montauk Point, the wind farm is projected to provide electricity to proved 70,000 Long Island homes. The project is the country's second large-scale offshore wind project (after a similar wind-power development in Massachusetts).In November 2021, <b>Biden</b> promised to end and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030, joining more than 100 other global leaders in the COP26 climate summit's first major agreement.In May 2022 the White House Council on Environmental Quality released a report in which it describes how Biden's administration followed the around 200 recommendations of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. The full report has around 150 pages. The report summarizes many of the steps taken by the administration on environmental issues. Among others, it mentions significant achievements in the domains of Energy efficiency, Weatherization, Transit-oriented development, Walking, Cycling, Mixed-use development, cooperation with Indigenous peoples of the Americas.In August 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law, a domestic spending bill born out of continued negotiations on the Build Back Better Act after its collapse that fulfilled some of its initial provisions. The bill included significant federal investment in domestic clean energy production, combatting climate change, and healthcare; it aims to reduce U.S. carbon emissions by 40% from peak 2005 levels by 2030, included a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, and empowered Medicare to begin negotiating lower prescription drug costs for the first time. === Electoral and ethical reform === In response to what <b>Biden</b> describes as the growing influence of special interests and gerrymandering in elections, he has pledged to seek electoral and government ethics reforms. <b>Biden</b> supported the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. In January 2022, he endorsed a change to senate filibuster rules after they both failed to invoke cloture. However, the rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.Known for his generally bipartisan tone, <b>Biden</b> avoided directly referring to his predecessor during his first year in office. Beginning in 2022, <b>Biden</b> condemned Trump and Trumpism in stronger terms; he likened the \"MAGA philosophy\" to \"semi-fascism\" and, in a a 2022 speech outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia, said the \"extreme ideology\" of Trump, and a Republican Party dominated by him, \"threatens the very foundation of our republic.\" <b>Biden</b> specifically condemned Trump and \"MAGA Republicans\" for promoting authoritarian leaders, using violent rhetoric, refusing to disavow political violence, and refusing to acknowledge election losses. <b>Biden</b> suggested that the 2022 United States elections could be illegitimate if federal laws are not passed to combat enacted voter-suppression legislation from state legislatures.Following the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, <b>Biden</b> called for reforms to the 1887 Electoral Count Act to clarify the roles of Congress and the Vice President in certifying electoral votes. The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 raised the threshold for objections to electoral votes, clarified that the vice president cannot decertify electoral votes, and modified the process for which electors are certified. It was included as part of the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act. === Immigration === On January 20, 2021, <b>Biden</b> halted the construction of the U.S.\u2013Mexico barrier and ended a related national emergency declared by Trump in February 2018. <b>Biden</b> issued a proclamation that ended the Trump travel ban imposed on predominantly Muslim countries in January 2017. <b>Biden</b> also reaffirmed protections to recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The same day, <b>Biden</b> sent a memorandum to the U.S. Department of State reinstating Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberians.On January 20, 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration issued a moratorium on deportations from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the first 100 days of his presidency. On January 22, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the <b>Biden</b> administration for violating Biden's written pledge to cooperatively work with the state of Texas. A federal judge in Texas subsequently issued a temporary restraining order barring the <b>Biden</b> administration from enforcing its moratorium, citing the lack of \"any concrete, reasonable justification for a 100-day pause on deportations.\"On January 21, 2021, <b>Biden</b> proposed a bill that, if passed, would replace the word alien with noncitizen in U.S. immigration law. The following day, <b>Biden</b> had a call with Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. On the call, <b>Biden</b> and L\u00f3pez Obrador spoke about immigration, where <b>Biden</b> spoke of reducing immigration from Mexico to the U.S. by targeting what <b>Biden</b> deemed as root causes. According to an Associated Press report, L\u00f3pez Obrador noted that <b>Biden</b> pledged $4 billion to \"help development in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u2014 nations whose hardships have spawned tides of migration through Mexico toward the United States.\"On January 23, <b>Biden</b> proposed an immigration bill aiming to give a path to citizenship to eleven million immigrants living in the U.S. without a permanent legal status. The bill would also make it easier for certain foreign workers to stay in the U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin called the bill \"aspirational\". It is widely expected not to pass both houses of Congress without significant revision.Biden instructed the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to focus on violent offenders of immigration laws rather than all offenders of immigration laws.In February 2021, it was reported that DHS agents who had been empowered by Trump to enact his anti-immigration policies were resisting and defying Biden's immigration policies. The union representing ICE agents signaled that its agents would not accept reversals of Trump policies.In March 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration granted temporary protected status to Venezuelans fleeing the country amidst the ongoing political and economic crisis.On June 1, 2021, the DHS officially terminated the Trump-era \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which mandated that all asylum seekers from Central America were to wait in Mexico pending their court cases; however, a health order from March 2020 allowed the border authorities to send migrants back for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic have remained in place. However, on August 14, 2021, a federal judge in Texas ordered the <b>Biden</b> administration to reimplement the policy; the Supreme Court placed a pause on the ruling to give the administration time for arguments. On August 24, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the <b>Biden</b> administration must comply with the lower court's ruling to reinstate the policy. ==== Unaccompanied minors ==== Early on in Biden's tenure, a surge in unaccompanied minors at the U.S. border stirred controversy. According to a 2021 Politico report, Republicans expected prior to <b>Biden</b> taking office that there would be a border surge at the start of 2021 (due to seasonal patterns and regional crises) and coordinated to make it a central issue in the lead-up to the 2022 mid-term elections. The number of migrants arriving in the U.S. from Central America had been rising since April 2020 due to ongoing violence, natural disasters, food insecurity, and poverty in the region. In February 2021, the U.S. Border Patrol reported a 61% increase in encounters with unaccompanied children from the month before. The reported 5,858 encounters in January to 9,457 in February constituted the largest one-month percentage increase in encounters with unaccompanied children since U.S. Customs and Border Protection began recording data in 2010. By the end of April 2021, the number of children held in Border Patrol facilities fell by 84%, placing them under HHS care.On March 24, 2021, <b>Biden</b> tasked Vice President Harris to reduce the number of unaccompanied minors and adult asylum seekers. She is also tasked with leading the negotiations with Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.The number of migrant families and unaccompanied children entering the U.S. from across the Southwest border steeply declined in August, September, and October 2021. === Separation of church and state === Biden, a practicing Catholic, has taken a public position of dissent against the Church's position opposing free-choice in the abortion issue. This has raised the question of whether his public office might allow him to influence the outcomes of current debates with the Church concerning abortion. The Vatican has taken a mediating position concerning Biden's dissent by allowing him to take Communion in Rome while visiting the Pope. === Social issues === During his early days in office, <b>Biden</b> focused on \"advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice and equal opportunity.\" According to The New York Times, Biden's early actions in office focused on racial equality more than any president since Lyndon B. Johnson, who passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On January 25, 2021, <b>Biden</b> signed an executive order that lifted the ban on transgender military service members. This reversed a memorandum imposed by Trump.The <b>Biden</b> administration is seeking to put Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill. This effort follows that of the <b>Obama</b> administration, which was blocked by Steven Mnuchin. Press secretary Psaki said it was important that U.S. money and notes reflect the \"history and diversity\" of the country and that putting Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill would do so.On January 20, 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration issued an Executive Order entitled Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government increasing the federal government's anti-bias enforcement against government contractors. The intent is heightened investigations and audits by the Department of Justice as well as more detailed follow-up inquiries with government contractors, with an emphasis on combatting pay discrimination. Also in January, <b>Biden</b> directed the U.S. Department of Justice to reduce their usage of private prisons and ordered the attorney general to not renew contracts with private prisons, citing the need to \"reduce profit-based incentives\" for the incarceration of racial minorities.Three days after the Atlanta spa shootings that killed 8 people, including 6 Asian women, <b>Biden</b> and Vice President Harris travelled to Atlanta. They spoke to Asian American and Pacific Islander advocates and leaders and condemned sexism, and racism against Asian Americans.Biden made Juneteenth (June 19) a federal holiday in 2021, celebrating the end of slavery in the U.S. In March 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law. With the enactment of that legislation, lynching was made a federal hate crime for the first time in American history.In October 2022, <b>Biden</b> pardoned all past federal marijuana possession charges and announced an inquiry into whether cannabis should be removed from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. In December 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act which was the first standalone cannabis-related bill ever passed by the United States Congress. ==== LGBT rights ==== The United States Department of Agriculture unveiled efforts in 2022 to prevent anti-LGBT discrimination in food programs, including school lunch programs, resulting in 20 lawsuits from 20 Republican attorneys general.In December 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), required states to recognize other states' marriage certificates for LGBT Americans, and ensured some religious liberties. The bill came from a push from Democrats to codify same-sex marriage after the Dobbs decision, particularly Clarence Thomas's push to reconsider other precedents.In January 2023, the <b>Biden</b> administration released an \"evidence agenda\" for LGBTQI+ Americans to learn about \"their experiences engaging with federal agencies and the disparities they face in their daily lives,\" as well as documenting how many LGBT people live in the United States. ==== Abortion ==== In December 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration ended a long-standing restriction on sales of abortion pills through the mail. This decision came amidst legal cases and Supreme Court decisions that jeopardized abortion access in the United States.Following the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey on June 24, 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, <b>Biden</b> addressed the nation in the Cross Hall of the White House. He mentioned that \"it's a sad day ... for the country\" and \"with Roe gone, ... The health and life of women in this nation are now at risk.\" In addition, he attacked the Court saying \"With this decision, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court shows how extreme it is\" and \"They have made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world.\" Regarding action, <b>Biden</b> stated that his administration will defend the right of women to seek an abortion in another state where abortion is legal and help protect a woman's access to contraception and abortion pills approved by the FDA. He also called on Congress to codify Roe v. Wade, saying \"No executive action ... can do that.\". But stated that if Congress did not have the votes to codify, that the voters would have to take action by \"elect[ing] more senators and representatives who will codify a woman's right to choose into federal law.\"The <b>Biden</b> administration rejected the call from progressives to allow abortions on federal land, with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying, \"in states where abortion is now illegal, women and providers who are not federal employees, as you look at the federal land, could be potentially \u2013 be prosecuted.\"During a press conference at the 2022 Madrid NATO Summit, <b>Biden</b> expressed support for providing an exception to the filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade. ==== Criminal justice ==== The <b>Biden</b> administration rescinded a Trump administration policy that curtailed the use of consent decrees that had been used by previous administrations in their investigations of misconduct in police departments.Biden proposed in his fiscal 2022 budget to more than double funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Hiring Program, which helps state and local governments to hire law enforcement officers. ==== Gun control ==== In a national address in March 2021, following mass shootings in the Atlanta area and Boulder, Colorado, <b>Biden</b> advocated for further gun regulations, such as a restored ban on assault weapons and a high-capacity magazine ban, as well as reinforcing preexisting background checks.Following the Robb Elementary School shooting on May 24, 2022, President <b>Biden</b> addressed the nation. The following week, he again called on Congress to pass an assault weapons and high-capacity magazine ban, as well as red flag laws and other legislation. As a result of the shooting, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was eventually passed by Congress and signed into law. It marked the first federal gun safety law to have been enacted in 30 years.Following the Colorado Springs nightclub shooting, <b>Biden</b> called again for an assault weapons ban. === Space policy === The <b>Biden</b> administration reversed the Trump administration's method of using the National Space Council to coordinate commercial, civil, and military space policies, instead using the National Security Council to issue national security memoranda instead of the Space Council's space policy directives. The <b>Biden</b> administration renewed the National Space Council, chaired by Vice President Harris, \"to assist the president in generating national space policies, strategies, and synchronizing America's space activities.\" Harris held meetings with the leaders of five countries to discuss international cooperation on space issues.The <b>Biden</b> administration continued the Artemis program to send people back to the Moon. The administration also emphasized the role of NASA in studying climate change.Biden appointed Bill Nelson, an astronaut and former U.S. Senator, to the post of NASA administrator. Nelson was confirmed unanimously by the Senate in April 2021.In April 2021, as part of his first annual budget request, <b>Biden</b> proposed a $24.8 billion budget for NASA in 2022, a $1.5 billion increase on what Congress allocated to 2021. The proposal includes funding for the Artemis program for a new crewed Moon landing mission. The proposal also included a 12.5% increase for NASA's Earth Science Division, as well as a 22% increase for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates a fleet of weather satellites; both measures aimed to use space tools to study and mitigate climate change.On December 1, 2021, <b>Biden</b> announced his new framework for US space policy, the United States Space Priorities Framework, which explains Biden's approach for commercial, civil, and military space activity. There is a new emphasis on combating climate change and investing in STEM education. === Education === In August 2022, <b>Biden</b> announced that the Department of Education would cancel certain federally owned student debt. Borrowers earning under $125,000 per year, or under $250,000 for married couples who file jointly, would be eligible for up to $10,000 in loan forgiveness. Borrowers who received a Pell Grant while attending college could qualify for up to an additional $10,000 in loan forgiveness, for a total of $20,000. The administration estimated that about 43 million borrowers would be covered by the plan, including about 20 million individuals whose student debt would be completely forgiven. On August 9, 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which supports STEM education with funding. === Trump wall === On October 5, 2023, Joe Biden's administration said on Thursday it will add sections to a border wall to stave off record migrant crossings from Mexico, carrying forward a signature policy of former President Donald Trump. One of Biden's first actions after taking office in January 2021 was to issue a proclamation pledging that \"no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall\" as well as a review of all resources that had already been committed. The administration said Thursday's action did not deviate from Biden's proclamation because money that was allocated during Trump's term in 2019 had to be spent now.Former president Trump was quick to claim victory and demand an apology:\"As I have stated often, over thousands of years, there are only two things that have consistently worked, wheels, and walls!\" Trump wrote on social media. \"Will Joe <b>Biden</b> apologize to me and America for taking so long to get moving...\". Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called the move \"a step backwards.\" == Foreign affairs == === Defense === On January 22, 2021, <b>Biden</b> signed his first bill, H.R. 335 into law, providing a waiver to the law preventing appointment of a Secretary of Defense who had been on active duty in the armed forces within the past seven years; this was the third time such a waiver was granted by Congress. Retired army four-star general Lloyd Austin was confirmed by the Senate in a 93\u20132 vote that same day, making Austin the first African-American Defense Secretary. Austin has said his number one priority is to assist COVID-19 relief efforts, pledging he would \"quickly review the Department's contributions to COVID-19 relief efforts, ensuring that we're doing everything that we can to help distribute vaccines across the country and to vaccinate our troops and preserve readiness.\"On February 10, 2021, <b>Biden</b> visited the Pentagon for the first time as U.S. president. In remarks to service members alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, <b>Biden</b> announced a U.S. Department of Defense-led China task force \"to provide a baseline assessment of department policies, programs and processes in regard to the challenge China poses.\"On June 18, 2021, the administration removed eight MIM-104 Patriot anti-missile batteries from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and Iraq, removed the THAAD anti-missile defense system from Saudi Arabia, and announced that most jet squadrons and hundreds of American troops would be withdrawn from the region. The changes come in light of both de-escalating tensions with Iran and the administration changing its focus on countering China.After taking office, <b>Biden</b> heavily restricted the use of armed drones and drone strikes. After Biden's first year in office, drone strikes had hit a 20-year low and were heavily limited by the administration. === China === <b>Biden</b> has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China and build \"a united front of U.S. allies and partners to confront China's abusive behaviors and human rights violations.\" He described China as the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges on the \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\" of the U.S.Biden nominated Antony Blinken to serve as Secretary of State who took office on January 26, 2021. During his nomination hearing, Blinken said that previous optimistic approaches to China were flawed, and that Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, \"was right in taking a tougher approach to China\" but he \"disagree[s] very much with the way [Trump] went about it in a number of areas.\" He endorsed former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's report that China is committing a genocide against Uyghur Muslims. In March 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and other administration officials met with the Chinese Communist Party Politburo member Yang Jiechi, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, and other Chinese officials in Alaska with heated exchanges on China's human rights abuses, cyberattacks, its threats against Taiwan, its crackdown in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and other issues of U.S. interest. The Chinese side countered: \"The U.S. does not have the qualification to speak to China from a position of strength [and] does not serve as a model to others [and] China's development and strengthening is unstoppable.\"The Washington Post reported that the <b>Biden</b> administration got \"a taste of China's 'wolf warrior' diplomacy\" during the first meeting with its Chinese counterpart, which was \"remarkably undiplomatic\", adding \"China's diplomats appeared more forceful than they had been in any public meeting during President Trump's term.\" The Atlantic published an article saying that the <b>Biden</b> team \"flushed Beijing's true intentions out into the open for the world to see\", quoting a senior administration official's comment that it is \"increasingly difficult to argue that we don't know what China wants.\"In April 2021, it was reported that the <b>Biden</b> administration was rallying U.S. allies in consideration of a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The U.S. Department of State spokesman Ned Price told reporters that a joint boycott \"is something that we certainly wish to discuss.\"In May 2021, the administration removed Chinese mobile manufacturer Xiaomi from the Chinese military blacklist, reversing the previous administration's decision.On June 3, 2021, <b>Biden</b> announced an executive order that would come into effect from August 2, and ban Americans from investing into 59 Chinese firms, including Huawei. Before it was announced, China said it would retaliate against it.In October 2021, <b>Biden</b> said he is concerned about Chinese hypersonic missiles, days after China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile that circled the globe before speeding towards its target.In December 2021, a coalition of Jewish organizations, including the American Jewish Committee and the Rabbinical Assembly, issued an open letter to <b>Biden</b> urging additional action in response to the Uyghur genocide. In late January and early February 2023, U.S. and Canadian defense officials were tracking a China-operated high-altitude balloon that had been seen hovering in North American airspace. The balloon's first reported sighting was on February 1, 2023, when a commercial airliner reported flying in close proximity to it. <b>Biden</b> ordered the U.S. Air Force to shoot down the balloon on February 4, on the possibility of it being a surveillance device, when it was spotted over territorial waters near South Carolina; at 2:39 p.m. that day, the balloon was downed by an F-22 Raptor that had departed from Langley Air Force Base. In response to the downing of the balloon, China admitted it belonged to them, but claimed the balloon was a weather device that had been blown off course. Chinese officials accused the U.S. of indiscriminately using force against the civilian airship in violation of international law. The incident increased tensions between the U.S. and China. On February 9, <b>Biden</b> stated that he did not believe that relations with China will be negatively affected by his decision to shoot down the balloon. The incident did prompt Secretary Blinken to delay a diplomatic visit to Beijing. === Taiwan === On 18 September 2022, it was reported by Reuters that \"Joe <b>Biden</b> said U.S forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, his most explicit statement on the issue, drawing an angry response from China that said it sent the wrong signal to those seeking an independent Taiwan.\" The policy was stated in contrast to Biden's previous exclusion of boots-on-the-ground and planes-in-the-air for U.S. support for Ukraine in its current conflict with Russia. === Cuba === Afghanistan In February 2020, the Trump administration made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021. In April 2021, President <b>Biden</b> formally announced that American troops would instead withdraw from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021, which would signal an end to the U.S.'s longest war. According to Princeton professor Julian E. Zelizer, <b>Biden</b> \"clearly learned a great deal from his time in the <b>Obama</b> presidency\", and demonstrated that \"he is a politician capable of learning and evolving, contrary to some of the skeptics in the primaries who thought he didn't understand how politics had changed.\" According to Washington Post journalist Steven Levingston, \"Obama listened to military leaders who advised him that withdrawal would be a mistake. Biden, meanwhile, was the top administration official arguing for a much more limited role for American forces in Afghanistan. Later, <b>Biden</b> would go on to say that he could tell by Obama's 'body language' that he agreed with that assessment \u2014 even though he ultimately rejected it.\"Soon after the withdrawal of U.S. troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of a collapsing Afghan Armed Forces. President <b>Biden</b> defended the withdrawal, saying \"I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and ... more competent in terms of conducting war.\"By early July 2021, most of the American troops in Afghanistan were withdrawn. <b>Biden</b> addressed the withdrawal, stating that: \"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\" On August 15, amid an offensive by the Taliban, the Afghan government collapsed, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and Kabul fell to the Taliban. <b>Biden</b> reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist in the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies. He has been criticized over the manner of the American withdrawal.On August 16, <b>Biden</b> addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it (\"the buck stops with me\"), and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\". He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\", since the \"Afghan military collapsed [against the Taliban], sometimes without trying to fight\". <b>Biden</b> partly attributed the lack of early evacuation of Afghan civilians to the Afghan government's opposition of a \"mass exodus\" which they thought would cause a \"crisis of confidence\".On August 26, a suicide attack was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Khorasan Province at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, killing more than 170 people, including at least 62 Afghan civilians, 13 US service members, two British nationals and the child of a third British national. <b>Biden</b> made a public address following the attack, in which he honored the American service members who were killed, calling them \"heroes\" and saying they lost their lives \"in the service of liberty\", and stated that the US had evacuated more than 100,000 Americans, Afghans, and others. He expressed deep sorrow for the Afghan victims as well. <b>Biden</b> said to those who wished harm upon the US that \"we will hunt you down and make you pay.\" <b>Biden</b> received increasingly harsh criticism from both Republicans and Democrats in the US Congress, with Republicans calling for his resignation or for his impeachment.After the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, the <b>Biden</b> administration froze about $9 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank, blocking the Taliban from accessing these billions of dollars in reserves held in U.S. bank accounts.In February 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed an executive order that seeks to unfreeze approximately $3.5 billion of Afghan assets in the U.S. for the purpose of humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan.On July 31, 2022, Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed in Kabul by an American drone strike approved by Biden. === Africa === <b>Biden</b> hosted a three-day U.S.-Africa summit in Washington in December 2022, attended by 49 African national leaders. The meeting was the first such summit since 2014. The leaders of every African nation in good standing with the African Union (AU), (except Eritrea) were invited to the summit. The leaders of African nations not in good standing with the AU (mostly those who had come to power through military coups) were also not invited.At the summit, <b>Biden</b> announced U.S. support for the AU joining the G20 group of major economies, a long-sought goal for Africa. The summit was part of a broader effort by the U.S. to rebuilt U.S.-African relations and counter Chinese influence on the continent. During the summit, the administration announced $800 million in new deals with Cisco Systems and Cybastion to combat cyberthreats targeting Africa, a bid to blunt the dominance of the Chinese firm Huawei in Africa. The administration also signed a memorandum of understanding in support of the African Continental Free Trade Area to reduce trade barriers in Africa, and committed $55 billion to Africa over the next three years, focused on preexisting U.S. initiatives, such as the trade-focused Prosper Africa and Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, as well as the Power Africa initiative, which aims to increase connections of Africans to the electric grid). The administration also emphasized initiatives in technology and cybersecurity, health, clean energy and the environment, and other areas. <b>Biden</b> committed an additional $2 billion for emergency humanitarian aid and $11 billion for food security programs in Africa. The administration also expanded ties with West Africa, including support for infrastructure improvements at the Benin seaport of Cotonou, a key part of the West African economy. <b>Biden</b> appointed longtime U.S. diplomat Johnnie Carson to coordinate implementation of U.S. actions following up from the summit.During the 2022 summit, <b>Biden</b> and senior administration officials also met privately with six African leaders facing elections in 2023, pushing them to ensure free and fair elections in their nations.Senator Bob Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has criticized the <b>Biden</b> administration for hesitating to impose sanctions on the governments of Sudan and Ethiopia, where many atrocities and war crimes were committed in the Tigray War. === Armenian genocide === On April 24, 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration declared that the Turkish killings of Armenians at the start of the 20th century were a genocide. He is the first U.S. president to ever officially recognize the Armenian genocide. === Americans detained abroad === In July 2022, President <b>Biden</b> signed an executive order aimed at deterring the wrongful detention of Americans abroad. According to an estimate by The James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, there are at least 67 U.S. citizens who are currently imprisoned abroad. The foundation further estimates that 90% of those are wrongly detained by foreign governments hostile to the U.S., including Venezuela, Russia, China, Iran, and others. Dozens of families of Americans who are detained abroad say President <b>Biden</b> has failed to adequately address the crisis. They formed a group called \"Bring Our Families Home Campaign\" to pressure <b>Biden</b> to do more. === Quad and the Indo-Pacific region === In March 2021, <b>Biden</b> held a virtual meeting with leaders of Japan, India and Australia, an alliance of countries known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or the Quad, that work together to address China's expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region. A few days later, the administration officials, including secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defense Lloyd Austin, met with U.S. allies in Asia and imposed sanctions on senior Chinese officials. Austin also visited India to deepen the defense ties between the two countries. In September 2021, <b>Biden</b> hosted the first in-person meeting of Quad at the White House.On May 23, 2022, <b>Biden</b> launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) to counter growing Chinese economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region. At the time of its launch, the IPEF had 12 partners including Australia, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. In response, China described the proposed grouping as a \"closed and exclusive club\". National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan defended the IPEF by highlighting the diverse nature of the grouping's membership. In November 2023, Under pressure from Congressional Democrats, the <b>Biden</b> administration In November 2023, the United States halted plans for the IPEF's trade component.In August 2022, the <b>Biden</b> administration announced that it will be hosting the US\u2013Pacific Island Country Summit in September 2022 which will coincide with the week of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly.On August 18, 2023, <b>Biden</b> hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David. The meeting, amid a period of strained Japan\u2013South Korea relations, resulted in the Camp David Principles relating to joint military exercises, preventing supply chain disruptions, and united criticism of North Korea, Russia, and China. === Russia === On the day of Biden's inauguration, the Russian government urged the new U.S. administration to take a \"more constructive\" approach in talks over the extension of the 2010 New START treaty, the sole remaining agreement limiting the number of U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear warheads. In Biden's first telephone call as president with Russian President Vladimir Putin, on January 26, 2021, <b>Biden</b> and Putin agreed to extend the New START treaty (which was set to expire in February 2021) by an additional five years.Biden and his administration condemned human rights violations by the Russian authorities, calling for the release of detained dissident and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, his wife, and the thousands of Russians who had demonstrated in his support; the U.S. called for the unconditional release of Navalny and the protestors and a credible investigation into Navalny's poisoning. On March 2, 2021, the U.S. and European Union imposed coordinated additional sanctions on Russian officials, as well as the FSB and GRU, over Navalny's poisoning and imprisonment. The State Department also expanded existing sanctions from the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act that had been imposed after the poisoning of Skripal. The <b>Biden</b> administration is also planning to impose sanctions against Russia because of the 2020 SolarWinds cyberespionage campaign, which compromised the computer systems of nine federal agencies. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the response \"will include a mix of tools seen and unseen, and it will not simply be sanctions.\"The <b>Biden</b> administration's comprehensive review into Russian activities has included an examination of reports that the Russian government offered bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The <b>Biden</b> administration said intelligence community has only \"low to moderate\" confidence in reports due to the fact that the bounty reports originated from \"detainee reporting and because of the difficult operating environment in Afghanistan.\" <b>Biden</b> called Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"killer\" in an ABC News interview, and said that Russia would pay a price for election meddling. On May 19, 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration lifted CAATSA sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Russia and Germany. Despite Biden's personal opposition to the project, the U.S. State Department says that it concluded that it was in the \"U.S. national interest\" to waive the sanctions. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov welcomed the move as \"a chance for a gradual transition toward the normalization of our bilateral ties.\" On June 16, 2021, <b>Biden</b> met with Putin in Geneva, Switzerland. The two presidents discussed a number of topics, including stable policy on climate change, nuclear proliferation, and cybersecurity. Russia's activities regarding Ukraine, Alexei Navalny, Belarus, and nationals jailed in each other's countries. The summit was significantly shorter than expected, only lasting three and a half of the predicted five hours. Putin praised <b>Biden</b> as a knowledgeable and shrewd negotiator the next day.In November 2021, Putin stated that an expansion of NATO's presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range missiles capable of striking Russian cities or missile defense systems similar to those in Romania and Poland, would be a \"red line\" issue for Russia. In December 2021, Putin asked President Joe <b>Biden</b> for legal guarantees that NATO wouldn't expand eastward or put \"weapons systems that threaten us in close vicinity to Russian territory.\" The U.S. and NATO have rejected Putin's demands.On February 24, 2022, <b>Biden</b> condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying Putin \"chose this war\" and calling him \"the aggressor\". He announced new sanctions against Russia. On February 25, the White House announced the US would personally sanction Putin and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. On February 28, the <b>Biden</b> administration announced sanctions against Russia's central bank, prohibiting Americans from doing business with the bank and freezing the bank's assets. On March 29, 2022, <b>Biden</b> appeared to heighten his condemnation concerning Putin made at the end of his NATO trip to Europe, stating that he makes \"no apologies\" for previously stating that \"Putin cannot remain in power\". On April 12, he called the war a \"genocide\". <b>Biden</b> criticized the Kremlin for \"idle comments\" on the possible use of nuclear weapons.On April 28, <b>Biden</b> asked Congress for an additional $33 billion to assist Ukraine, including $20 billion to provide weapons to Ukraine. On May 10, the House passed legislation that would provide $40 billion in new aid to Ukraine. The New York Times reported that the United States provided real-time battlefield targeting intelligence to Ukraine that helped Ukrainian forces kill Russian generals and sink the Russian warship Moskva. The <b>Biden</b> administration has pledged to help the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute Putin and others for war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine. === Ukraine === In February 2022, amid rising tensions between Ukraine and Russia, the <b>Biden</b> administration faced questions for its year-long failure to nominate an ambassador to Ukraine.The Russian invasion of Ukraine instigated significant and substantial support to Ukraine during the <b>Biden</b> presidency including two dozen military aid packages to assist them against the invasion. On 28 October 2022 the Pentagon announced the 24th presidential drawdown of materiel worth $275 million; the security assistance has totalled $18.5 billion to Ukraine since January 2021. The aid includes 500 Excalibur precision-guided 155mm artillery rounds, 2000 155mm remote anti-armor mine systems, more than 1,300 anti-armor weapons, more than 2.75 million rounds of small arms ammunition, more HIMARS rockets, 125 Humvees, and four satellite communications antennas for Ukraine's command and control systems, as well as training for operation of the NASAMS units. Two NASAMS units arrived in Ukraine on 7 November 2022.On February 20, 2023, four days before the one-year anniversary of the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, <b>Biden</b> visited Kyiv and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska. While there, <b>Biden</b> affirmed more military aid to Ukraine and denounced the war. The trip was unannounced, and involved major security coordinations to ensure safety. === Europe === President <b>Biden</b> promised to repair \"strained\" relationships with European allies in contrast to his predecessor Trump. \"An attack on one is an attack on all. That is our unshakeable vow,\" <b>Biden</b> said, referring to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty (the mutual defense clause). <b>Biden</b> pledged support for the European project and for Ukraine's sovereignty as well as the need for global cooperation on fighting the pandemic and climate change. U.S. relations with France deteriorated in September 2021 due to fallout from the AUKUS security pact between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, which aimed to counter Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific region. As part of the agreement, the U.S. agreed to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. After entering into the agreement, the Australian government canceled an agreement that it had made with France for the provision of French conventionally powered submarines. The deal angered the French government, which recalled its ambassador to the U.S. (Philippe \u00c9tienne) as well as the ambassador to Australia. Amid the diplomatic row, the French Foreign Ministry contended that it had been subjected to \"duplicity, disdain and lies\" and French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the deal a \"stab in the back\". In a conciliatory call a few days later, <b>Biden</b> and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to reduce bilateral tensions, and the White House acknowledged the crisis could have been averted if there had been open consultations between allies. A month later, <b>Biden</b> met Macron, telling him his administration was \"clumsy\" and that he was \"under the impression that France had been informed long before\" that France's deal with Australia was \"not going through\". === Iran === The <b>Biden</b> administration has expressed interest in re-engaging with Iran on the Iran nuclear deal. Biden's predecessor, President Trump, withdrew from the deal in 2018, resulting in swift backlash from international community. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. would be interested in re-entering the agreement so long as Iran shows \"strict compliance\". Blinken did not rule out a military intervention to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.On February 25, 2021, President <b>Biden</b> ordered retaliatory airstrikes on buildings in Syria that the Department of Defense said were used by Iranian-backed militias to carry out rocket attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq. The operation was the first known use of military force by the <b>Biden</b> administration. The attacks prompted condemnation from many Democratic members of Congress. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia questioned the administration's \"legal justification for acting without coming to Congress.\" Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA) claimed that \"the Administration should have sought Congressional authorization.\"In July 2022, <b>Biden</b> met with Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid to discuss the Iran nuclear deal and said that he continued to favor diplomacy. Lapid, however, expressed that only military threat would deter Iran from pursuing a nuclear program. === Myanmar === On February 1, 2021, <b>Biden</b> condemned the Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat and called for the release of detained officials. <b>Biden</b> also left open the door to re-imposing sanctions on the country, saying in a statement that \"[t]he United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action.\"On March 5, 2021, <b>Biden</b> imposed sanctions on Myanmar's Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Defence and certain junta conglomerates. On March 22, 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced sanctions on several military generals in response to a violent crackdown on peaceful protests. === Northern Ireland === <b>Biden</b> has reiterated his commitment to maintaining peace in Northern Ireland by resisting the possibility of a hard border as a result of Brexit. When asked by The Irish Times in March 2021 about comments made by Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney that the UK \"cannot be trusted\" on the Northern Ireland protocol, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that \"President <b>Biden</b> has been unequivocal about his support for the Good Friday Agreement.\" As part of his own Irish-American heritage, Psaki said that <b>Biden</b> \"has a special place in his heart for the Irish\", underpinning his commitment to Northern Ireland's peace. === Saudi Arabia and Yemen === <b>Biden</b> ordered a halt in the arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which the Trump administration had previously agreed to. Two years after Jamal Khashoggi's assassination, Avril Haines, the Director of National Intelligence under Biden's administration, announced that the intelligence report into the case against the Saudi government would be declassified. It was reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would be blamed for the murder, as was concluded by the CIA.On February 4, 2021, the <b>Biden</b> administration announced that the U.S. was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. President <b>Biden</b> in his first visit to the State Department as president said \"this war has to end\" and that the conflict has created \"a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe\". However, the details of the end of American involvement in the war have yet to be released as of April 2021.In September 2021, Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan met in Saudi Arabia with Crown Prince Bin Salman to discuss the high oil prices. The record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19. The <b>Biden</b> administration was pressed on potential oil deals with Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Iran that would have them increase their oil production. However, so far, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have declined requests from the US.As a presidential candidate, Joe <b>Biden</b> had vowed to make the Saudis \"pay the price\" and make them a \"pariah\" state, citing the Kingdom's involvement in the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. But, in June 2022, the White House confirmed that <b>Biden</b> was to visit Saudi Arabia and meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, during his Middle East trip in July. The announcement came after inflation in the US rose to a 40-year high. The Russian invasion of Ukraine also had an impact on the oil and gas prices in the US. <b>Biden</b> repeatedly appealed to the Saudis to increase oil production, but the Kingdom turned down such requests. Biden's planned visit was seen as a move to seek Saudi assistance to ease the oil and gas prices at home. However, human rights activists and Democratic lawmakers warned <b>Biden</b> that the visit could send signals to Saudi that their horrific human rights violations could be exempted. Saudi dissidents living in the US said that as Saudi activists who were wronged by Prince Mohammed, they \"feel betrayed by Biden\". Son of Saad Aljabri, Khalid AlJabri said Biden's meeting with MbS would be \"equivalent of a presidential pardon for murder\". Democratic Representative Adam Schiff also criticized the visit saying, \"I wouldn't go. I wouldn't shake his hand. This is someone who butchered an American resident, cut him up into pieces and in the most terrible and premeditated way.\"On 10 July 2022, president <b>Biden</b> defended his trip to Saudi Arabia, saying humans rights were on his agenda. In an op-ed, he wrote that he aims to \"reorient and not rupture relations with a country that's been a strategic partner for 80 years\", and that Saudi Arabia has helped to restore unity among the six countries of Gulf Cooperation Council and has fully supported the truce in the context of the Yemen war.Ahead of Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia, reports revealed that the <b>Biden</b> administration could possibly lift a ban on sales of Offensive weapons to Riyadh. However, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan they were focused on a \"real ceasefire\", and on Saudi efforts to end the war. Following the meeting with Saudi officials, <b>Biden</b> announced that the Kingdom committed to extend the truce in Yemen. On 2 August 2022, the State Department approved the potential sale of 300 MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missile-Tactical Ballistic Missiles (GEM-T) for the Patriot missile defense system to Saudi Arabia. It also approved support equipment, spares and technical support to the Arab nation. In addition, the State Department also approved the potential sale of 96 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system interceptors and support equipment to the UAE. However, Human Rights Watch said the US should suspend sales of both offensive and defensive arms to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which have used American weapons in unlawful airstrikes. HRW said a policy reversal by the US could lead to added rights violations in Yemen. === United Arab Emirates === The U.S. authorities indicted Thomas J. Barrack Jr., an outside adviser to Donald Trump during and after the 2016 United States presidential election campaign. They alleged he acted as an unregistered foreign lobbyist for the United Arab Emirates. Barrack was also accused of obstruction of justice by giving false statements to the investigators. He was found not guilty on all charges in November 2022. The DOJ also prosecuted some men for funneling more than $3.5 million to Hillary Clinton from George Nader, the royal adviser of the UAE.While federal prosecutors accused the Emirates of interfering in American politics from both sides, the relations with the Arab nation during Biden's presidency didn't witness much of the expected changes. The UAE was seen escaping its blunder-filled history of relations with the US, despite Biden's repetitive criticism against the Emirates' human rights violations and its attempts of infiltrating the US politics. Moreover, the <b>Biden</b> administration also permitted the arms sales of $23 billion to the UAE, which was initiated by Donald Trump and involved a transfer of sophisticated weaponry like the F-35 fighter jets. The US Justice Department did not charge any Emirati in the case. However, Barrack's indictment identified three UAE officials who were hosts at his reception in the Gulf nation after Trump's 2016 elections, and two others who were involved. Amongst the hosts was Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed, the UAE's national security adviser Tahnoun bin Zayed and director of the Emirati intelligence service, Ali Mohammed Hammad Al Shamsi. The fourth Emirati official was Abdullah Khalifa Al Ghafli, who \"tasked\" Barrack to push Emirati interests with America. Another official was Yousef Al Otaiba, who asked to remain anonymous in discussions over private matters. === Israel === Early in the <b>Biden</b> administration, the White House confirmed that the U.S. Embassy would remain in Jerusalem, which would remain recognized as the Capital. The administration also expressed support for the Abraham Accords while wanting to expand on them, although it shied away from using that name, instead referring to it simply as \"the normalization process\".On 13 May 2021, in the aftermath of the Al-Aqsa mosque conflict, the <b>Biden</b> administration was accused of being indifferent towards the violent conflict between Israeli statehood and the Palestinian minority there. Critics on both sides identified the reaction by the White House as \"lame and late\".On 21 May 2021, a ceasefire was brokered between Israel and Hamas after eleven days of clashes. According to Biden, the US will be playing a key role to rebuild damaged infrastructure in the Gaza alongside the Palestinian authority. ==== Israel\u2013Hamas War ==== After the October 7 terrorist attack in Israel perpetrated by Hamas, <b>Biden</b> stated, \"We stand with Israel\" three days later and emphasized the US's role in potentially freeing American hostages in Gaza.On October 14, <b>Biden</b> condemned the murder of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a six-year-old Muslim boy in Chicago, by the boy's landlord. The murder was an alleged hate crime inspired by the conflict. <b>Biden</b> said, \"There is no place in America for hate against anyone.\"During a speech at the Human Rights Campaign Dinner on October 15, a protestor chanted \"let Gaza live\" and \"ceasefire now\" to which <b>Biden</b> responded that he could not hear the protestor, but then later said \"I get it. I'm not sure that's a good thing. No, I'm only joking.\"Biden's trip to Jordan to meet King Abdullah II, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, and Mahmoud Abbas was \"mutually\" canceled on October 17 and indefinitely postponed.President <b>Biden</b> traveled to Tel Aviv, Israel on October 18 and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, resulting in humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza, including food, water, and medicine. During the trip, <b>Biden</b> blamed the al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion on \"an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza,\" citing US intelligence reports. He also promised to ask congress for an \"unprecedented support package for Israel\u2019s defense,\" potentially tied to a bill with support for Ukraine, Taiwan, and the Southern Border. <b>Biden</b> also announced that the US would send $100 million in humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank.On November 1, after Jessica Rosenberg, a rabbi and activist from Jewish Voice for Peace, heckled <b>Biden</b> during a speech in Northfield, Minnesota calling for a ceasefire, <b>Biden</b> said, \"I think we need a pause. A pause means give time to get the prisoners out.\"Starting November 9, <b>Biden</b> negotiated four-hour pauses for civilians to flee every day after his push for three-day pauses failed. Starting on November 23, Israel agreed to a four-day ceasefire for north of Gaza for six hours a day and a complete ceasefire south of Gaza in exchange for hostages taken by Hamas. The deal was brokered by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. === Palestine === During a July 2022 visit to Israel, <b>Biden</b> stressed the importance of keeping the two-state vision alive. He met with Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and announced a new aid package to the Palestinians. During the administration of his predecessor Donald Trump, U.S. contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees had been defunded. On the Israeli end, Prime Minister Yair Lapid reaffirmed his position on a two-state solution. === Worldwide LGBT rights === On February 4, 2021, <b>Biden</b> issued a presidential memorandum for expanding protection of LGBT rights worldwide, which includes the possibility to impose financial sanctions.The US State Department released a statement on Intersex Awareness Day promoting LGBTQI+ rights around the globe, saying, \"Intersex persons often face stigma and discrimination in accessing education, healthcare, and legal recognition, and are subjected to medically unnecessary surgeries. These harmful practices, which can cause lifelong negative physical and emotional consequences, are a medical form of so-called conversion therapy practices in that they seek to physically \u201cconvert\u201d Intersex children into non-Intersex children.\"Biden announced he would be removing Uganda from the African Growth and Opportunity Act trade deal over the country's anti-LGBT bill that included the death penalty for \"aggravated homosexuality\" and life-in-prison for identifying as LGBT. == Investigations of <b>Biden</b> == === Hur special counsel investigation === Soon after Biden's attorneys informed the National Archives Administration in November 2022 that classified documents from before Biden's presidency had been found at the Penn <b>Biden</b> Center, Attorney General Garland tasked U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. with conduct an initial investigation. On January 5, 2023, Lausch advised Garland that the assignment of a special counsel was warranted. On January 12, Garland announced that he was appointing a special counsel to investigate \"possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records\", and appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel. === Congressional investigations === === Impeachment inquiry === On September 12, 2023, Speaker McCarthy acceded to the right wing of the House Republican Conference and announced the launch of an impeachment inquiry into Biden.McCarthy claimed that earlier findings of House investigations \"paint a picture of corruption\" involving <b>Biden</b> and his relatives. Prior investigations have failed to find evidence of wrongdoing by the president. == Elections during the <b>Biden</b> presidency == === 2022 midterm elections === Despite Biden's low approvals, a red wave did not occur during the president's first midterm as many had anticipated. Democrats expanded their narrow Senate majority while Republicans took control of the House of Representatives by a far smaller margin than expected. This was largely attributed to a backlash against the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, as well as the perceived extremeness of certain Republican candidates in competitive races. It was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party didn't lose any state legislative chambers or incumbent senators.Many pundits had failed to predict the Democrats' resilient performance; Simon Rosenberg was one exception. Polls for the election cycle were the most accurate since 1998, though Republican-aligned pollsters such as the Trafalgar Group had a notable polling miss.The results drew praise from the Democratic Party, and <b>Biden</b> celebrated the results as a strong day for democracy. === 2024 re-election campaign === After speculation <b>Biden</b> would not seek re-election due to his advanced age and poor job approval, <b>Biden</b> officially announced his re-election campaign on April 25, 2023. == Approval ratings and image == Very early in Biden's presidency, opinion polls found that Biden's approval ratings were steadier than Trump's, with an average approval rating of 55% and an average disapproval rate of 39%. Biden's early approval ratings have been more polarized than Trump's, with 98% of Democrats, 61% of independents and 11% of Republicans approving of Biden's presidency in February 2021, a party gap of 87%. Around the end of his first hundred days in office, Biden's approval rating was higher than Trump's but was the third worst since the presidency of Harry Truman; only Trump and Gerald Ford scored lower.Following the fall of Kabul and the surge of COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant in July and August 2021, Biden's approval rating began to steadily decline, from a high of 52.7% approval on July 26, 2021, to 45.9% approval by September 3, 2021, according to FiveThirtyEight. While the White House emphasized COVID-19 as causing his low approval rating, inflation, the highest in nearly 40 years, has also been described as a cause. Biden's lowest approval rating on record comes from a Quinnipiac University poll in July 2022, which showed just 31% of respondents approving of his performance as president.By the one-year anniversary of Biden's presidency on January 20, 2022, Gallup recorded the average approval rating for Biden's first year as 49%, which was the second-lowest first-year average approval rating for any American president since World War II; only Trump's first-year average of 38.4% was lower. Gallup further noted that there was greater political polarization in Biden's approval ratings than any other first-year president in modern history, with 91% of Democrats supporting <b>Biden</b> while just 8% of Republicans supported him, resulting in a party gap of 83%. The only other year of any presidency that saw greater polarization was Trump's final year in office. The July 2022 Gallup survey saw Biden's sixth quarter approval rating of 40%, the lowest sixth quarter rating of any president in modern history dating back to Dwight Eisenhower. Until April 23, according to figures compiled by FiveThirtyEight, Biden's approval rating stood at 42.3 percent, a slight improvement from the sub-40 percent level reached in the summer of 2022, but still well below the peak of 53 percent when he began his presidency in January 2021.According to Gallup, in October 2023, Biden's approval rating dropped to 37% and dropped 11 points among Democrats. An October 30, 2023 poll by the Arab American Institute, support for <b>Biden</b> among Arab Americans dropped from 59% in 2020 to 17%. The drop in support has been attributed to the administration's handling of the 2023 Israel-Hamas War. == Media appearances == <b>Biden</b> has been interviewed for several news outlets and appeared on several late-night talk shows throughout his presidency. In December 2021, <b>Biden</b> appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon where they discussed \"his Build Back Better Plan, the importance of his bipartisan friendship with the late Sen. Bob Dole, rejecting extremism and getting Americans vaccinated against COVID-19.\"In June 2022, <b>Biden</b> appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! where he discussed \"27 school shootings in America in 2022, why he believes nothing has been done so far about gun violence, an overwhelming amount of Americans supporting background checks, meeting with families after the tragic events in Uvalde, Texas, the idea of passing an Executive Order, the strides made in regards to Climate Change, Joe Manchin & Kyrsten Sinema's voting record, housing, food and gas prices being very high and what he intends to do about inflation, the negative impact that the pandemic has had on families and the need for mental health care, being optimistic about this generation of young people, changes in the press, his process for flushing documents down the toilets, what his intentions are if Roe v Wade does in fact get overturned, and his hopes for America.\"In July 2022, comedian and host of The Late Late Show, James Corden, visited the White House and spoke with Biden, Jen Psaki, and White House custodian staff. He also gave a fake press briefing in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.Biden has also been interviewed by Drew Barrymore, Jake Tapper, Jonathan Capehart, Yonit Levi, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, Scott Pelley, Lester Holt, and Norah O'Donnell, for The Drew Barrymore Show, CNN, MSNBC, Channel 12 in Israel, ABC News, 60 Minutes, NBC, and CBS News, as well as a solo interview by Heather Cox Richardson and Brian Tyler Cohen. Notably, <b>Biden</b> has not sat down with Fox News, despite its popularity in the United States.News outlets have criticized <b>Biden</b> for only doing a limited amount of interviews during his tenure. <b>Biden</b> participated in 23 interviews in his first 100 days, compared to 95 for Donald Trump, 187 for Barack Obama, 60 for George W. Bush, 64 for Bill Clinton, 70 for George H. W. Bush, and 78 for Ronald Reagan. == Notes == == References == == Further reading == Foer, Franklin (2023).

Biden, a Democrat from Delaware who previously served as vice president under Barack Obama, took office following his victory in the 2020 presidential election over Republican incumbent president Donald Trump. Upon his inauguration, he became the oldest president in American history, breaking the record set by his predecessor Trump. <b>Biden</b> entered office amid the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic crisis, and increased political polarization.On the first day of his presidency, <b>Biden</b> made an effort to revert President Trump's energy policy by restoring U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement and revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. He also halted funding for Trump's border wall, an expansion of the Mexican border wall. On his second day, he issued a series of executive orders to reduce the impact of COVID-19, including invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, and set an early goal of achieving one hundred million COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in his first 100 days.Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021; a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that temporarily established expanded unemployment insurance and sent $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans in response to continued economic pressure from COVID-19. He signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act; a ten-year plan brokered by <b>Biden</b> alongside Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to invest in American roads, bridges, public transit, ports and broadband access. <b>Biden</b> signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, making Juneteenth a federal holiday in the United States. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2014the first Black woman to serve on the court. After The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, <b>Biden</b> took executive actions, such as the signing of Executive Order 14076, to preserve and protect women's health rights nationwide, against abortion bans in Republican led states. <b>Biden</b> proposed a significant expansion of the U.S. social safety net through the Build Back Better Act, but those efforts, along with voting rights legislation, failed in Congress. However, in August 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a domestic appropriations bill that included some of the provisions of the Build Back Better Act after the entire bill failed to pass. It included significant federal investment in climate and domestic clean energy production, tax credits for solar panels, electric cars and other home energy programs as well as a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. <b>Biden</b> signed the CHIPS and Science Act, bolstering the semiconductor and manufacturing industry, the Honoring our PACT Act, expanding healthcare for US veterans, and the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act. In late 2022, <b>Biden</b> signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and codified same-sex and interracial marriage in the United States. In response to the debt-ceiling crisis of 2023, <b>Biden</b> negotiated and signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which restrains federal spending for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, implements minor changes to SNAP and TANF, includes energy permitting reform, claws back some IRS funding and unspent money for COVID-19, and suspends the debt ceiling to January 1, 2025. <b>Biden</b> established the American Climate Corps and created the first ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. On September 26, 2023, Joe <b>Biden</b> visited a United Auto Workers picket line during the 2023 United Auto Workers strike, making him the first US president to visit one. The foreign policy goal of the <b>Biden</b> administration is to restore the US to a \"position of trusted leadership\" among global democracies in order to address the challenges posed by Russia and China. In foreign policy, <b>Biden</b> completed the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan, declaring an end to nation-building efforts and shifting U.S. foreign policy toward strategic competition with China and, to a lesser extent, Russia. However, during the withdrawal, the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control, leading to <b>Biden</b> receiving bipartisan criticism. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia as well as providing Ukraine with over $100 billion in combined military, economic, and humanitarian aid. <b>Biden</b> also approved a raid which led to the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the leader of the Islamic State, and approved a drone strike which killed Ayman Al Zawahiri, leader of Al-Qaeda. <b>Biden</b> signed AUKUS, an international security alliance, together with Australia and the United Kingdom. <b>Biden</b> called for the expansion of NATO with the addition of Finland and Sweden, and rallied NATO allies in support of Ukraine. During the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war, <b>Biden</b> condemned Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism and announced American military support for Israel; <b>Biden</b> also showed his support and sympathy towards Palestinians affected by the war, sent humanitarian aid, and brokered a four-day ceasefire. <b>Biden</b> began his term with over 50% approval ratings; however, these fell significantly after the withdrawal from Afghanistan and remained low as the country experienced high inflation and rising gas prices. His age and mental fitness have also been a subject of discussion.", "Words": ["Obama", "Biden"]}, {"title": "Family of Joe Biden", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "content": "Joe Biden, the 46th and current president of the United States, has family members who are prominent in law, education, activism and politics. Biden's immediate family became the first family of the United States on his inauguration on January 20, 2021. His immediate family circle was also the second family of the United States from 2009 to 2017, when <b>Biden</b> was vice president. Biden's family is mostly descended from the British Isles, with most of their ancestors coming from Ireland and England, and a smaller number descending from the French.Of Joe Biden's sixteen great-great-grandparents, ten were born in Ireland. He is descended from the Blewitts of County Mayo and the Finnegans of County Louth. One of Biden's great-great-great-grandfathers was born in Sussex, England, and emigrated to Maryland in the United States by 1820. == Wives == === Neilia Hunter <b>Biden</b> === Neilia Hunter Biden, the first wife of Joe Biden, was born on July 28, 1942. The couple married on August 27, 1966. After the wedding, the Bidens moved to Wilmington, Delaware, where <b>Biden</b> was on the New Castle County Council. The couple had three children: Joseph Robinette \"Beau\" III, Robert Hunter and Naomi Christina \"Amy\". <b>Biden</b> campaigned to unseat the U.S. Senator from Delaware J. Caleb Boggs; Neilia was described by The News Journal as the \"brains\" of his victorious campaign.On December 18, 1972, while her husband was still a U.S. senator-elect, Neilia was driving with Naomi, Beau, and Hunter to buy a Christmas tree. Neilia \"drove into the path\" of a tractor-trailer, \"possibly because her head was turned and she didn't see the oncoming truck\". Neilia and the children were taken to Wilmington General Hospital. Neilia and Naomi died upon arrival, but her two sons survived with serious injuries. <b>Biden</b> was sworn in to the U.S. Senate on January 3, 1973, at the hospital where his sons were being treated. === Jill <b>Biden</b> === Jill Tracy Jacobs <b>Biden</b> (n\u00e9e Jacobs, formerly Stevenson), the second and current wife of Joe Biden, was born on June 3, 1951. She met <b>Biden</b> while on a blind date in March 1975. She and Joe <b>Biden</b> were married by a Catholic priest on June 17, 1977, at the Chapel at the United Nations in New York City. This was four and a half years after his first wife and infant daughter died; Joe had proposed several times before she accepted, as she was wary of entering the public spotlight, anxious to remain focused on her own career, and initially hesitant to take on the commitment of raising his two young sons who had survived the accident. == Children == Joe <b>Biden</b> fathered four children from two marriages.

Two other of Biden's third paternal great-grandfathers, Jesse Robinett and Thomas Randle, were slave owners in 19th century Maryland.A possible connection may also exist to the family of a William Henry Biden, who was from Houghton, Cambridgeshire, and lived from 1791 to 1843. This William Henry was a son of John <b>Biden</b> (died 28 July 1796) and his wife Ann Beaumont, who had married in 1781.

William Henry commanded mid-sized vessels before his death at Rangoon in 1843.Christopher <b>Biden</b> subsequently became an official in the Madras Civil Service (later the Indian Civil Service), and his descendants settled in India. He died at Madras in 1858. In 1981, Christopher's great-great-grandson, Leslie Dunn Biden, then living in Nagpur, wrote to Joe <b>Biden</b> about the possible family connection after reading about him in the Illustrated Weekly of India. After discussing their genealogy, they promised to stay in touch but did not resume correspondence before Leslie's death in 1983. During a 2013 visit to India, Joe <b>Biden</b> referred to Leslie's letter, mentioning a \"Biden from Mumbai\" had suggested their \"mutual great-great-great-great-something-or-other\" named George had \"worked for the East India Company back in the 1700s.\" === Maternal === Jean's parents were Geraldine Catherine (n\u00e9e Blewitt) Finnegan and Ambrose Joseph Finnegan from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Ambrose was born in Olyphant, Pennsylvania in 1883, and attended Santa Clara University where he was a star quarterback on their football team. After college, he worked for real estate investor Major Bowes in San Francisco until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake wiped out his boss's investments. He then returned to the Scranton area where he worked for many years as a newspaper advertising salesman and then as librarian for two Scranton newspapers. He died in 1957.Jean was of Irish descent, with roots variously attributed to County Louth and County Londonderry.: 8 Irish genealogists presented Joe <b>Biden</b> with his Irish maternal family history on his visit there in 2016. Joe's matrilineal great-grandfather (Geraldine's father), Edward Francis Blewitt, the child of Irish emigrants from Rappagh, Ballina, County Mayo, was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate. With all Joe Biden's maternal ancestors, and his paternal great-grandmother Mary Ann Hanafee, having purely Irish origins, this makes Joe <b>Biden</b> 62.5% of Irish descent. == See also == Family of Barack Obama, president for whom <b>Biden</b> served as vice president (2009\u20132017) Family of Kamala Harris, Biden's vice president (since 2021) == References == == Further reading == Russell, Katie (November 3, 2020). \"Joe Biden's family tree: how tragedy shaped the US presidential candidate\".

The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet\u2014with the highest register in the brass family\u2014to the bass trumpet, pitched one octave below the standard B\u266d or C trumpet. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 2000 BC. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through slightly separated lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \"buzzing\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B\u266d (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter. == Etymology == The English word trumpet was first used in the late 14th century. The word came from Old French trompette, which is a diminutive of trompe. The word trump, meaning trumpet, was first used in English in 1300. The word comes from Old French trompe 'long, tube-like musical wind instrument' (12c.), cognate with Proven\u00e7al tromba, Italian tromba, all probably from a Germanic source (compare Old High German trumpa, Old Norse trumba 'trumpet'), of imitative origin.\" == History == The earliest trumpets date back to 2000 BC and earlier. The bronze and silver Tutankhamun's trumpets from his grave in Egypt, bronze lurs from Scandinavia, and metal trumpets from China date back to this period. Trumpets from the Oxus civilization (3rd millennium BC) of Central Asia have decorated swellings in the middle, yet are made out of one sheet of metal, which is considered a technical wonder for its time.The Salpinx was a straight trumpet 62 inches (1,600 mm) long, made of bone or bronze. Homer\u2019s Iliad (9th or 8th century BCE) contain the earliest reference to its sound and further, frequent descriptions are found throughout the Classical Period. Salpinx contests were a part of the original Olympic Games. The Shofar, made from a ram horn and the Hatzotzeroth, made of metal, are both mentioned in the Bible. They were said to have been played in Solomon's Temple around 3,000 years ago. They are still used on certain religious days.The Moche people of ancient Peru depicted trumpets in their art going back to AD 300. The earliest trumpets were signaling instruments used for military or religious purposes, rather than music in the modern sense; and the modern bugle continues this signaling tradition. Improvements to instrument design and metal making in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance led to an increased usefulness of the trumpet as a musical instrument. The natural trumpets of this era consisted of a single coiled tube without valves and therefore could only produce the notes of a single overtone series. Changing keys required the player to change crooks of the instrument. The development of the upper, \"clarino\" register by specialist trumpeters\u2014notably Cesare Bendinelli\u2014would lend itself well to the Baroque era, also known as the \"Golden Age of the natural trumpet.\" During this period, a vast body of music was written for virtuoso trumpeters. The art was revived in the mid-20th century and natural trumpet playing is again a thriving art around the world. Many modern players in Germany and the UK who perform Baroque music use a version of the natural trumpet fitted with three or four vent holes to aid in correcting out-of-tune notes in the harmonic series.The melody-dominated homophony of the classical and romantic periods relegated the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers owing to the limitations of the natural trumpet. Berlioz wrote in 1844: Notwithstanding the real loftiness and distinguished nature of its quality of tone, there are few instruments that have been more degraded (than the trumpet). Down to Beethoven and Weber, every composer \u2013 not excepting Mozart \u2013 persisted in confining it to the unworthy function of filling up, or in causing it to sound two or three commonplace rhythmical formulae. == Construction == The trumpet is constructed of brass tubing bent twice into a rounded oblong shape. As with all brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through slightly separated lips, producing a \"buzzing\" sound into the mouthpiece and starting a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the trumpet. The player can select the pitch from a range of overtones or harmonics by changing the lip aperture and tension (known as the embouchure). The mouthpiece has a circular rim, which provides a comfortable environment for the lips' vibration. Directly behind the rim is the cup, which channels the air into a much smaller opening (the back bore or shank) that tapers out slightly to match the diameter of the trumpet's lead pipe. The dimensions of these parts of the mouthpiece affect the timbre or quality of sound, the ease of playability, and player comfort. Generally, the wider and deeper the cup, the darker the sound and timbre. Modern trumpets have three (or, infrequently, four) piston valves, each of which increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch. The first valve lowers the instrument's pitch by a whole step (two semitones), the second valve by a half step (one semitone), and the third valve by one and a half steps (three semitones). Having three valves provides eight possible valve combinations (including \"none\"), but only seven different tubing lengths, because the third valve alone gives essentially the same tubing length as the 1\u20132 combination. (In practice there is often a deliberately designed slight difference between \"1\u20132\" and \"3\", and in that case trumpet players will select the alternative that gives the best tuning for the particular note being played.) When a fourth valve is present, as with some piccolo trumpets, it usually lowers the pitch a perfect fourth (five semitones). Used singly and in combination these valves make the instrument fully chromatic, i.e., able to play all twelve pitches of classical music. For more information about the different types of valves, see Brass instrument valves. The overall pitch of the trumpet can be raised or lowered by the use of the tuning slide. Pulling the slide out lowers the pitch; pushing the slide in raises it. Pitch can be \"bent\" using the embouchure only.To overcome the problems of intonation and reduce the use of the slides, Renold Schilke designed the tuning-bell trumpet. Removing the usual brace between the bell and a valve body allows the use of a sliding bell; the player may then tune the horn with the bell while leaving the slide pushed in, or nearly so, thereby improving intonation and overall response.A trumpet becomes a closed tube when the player presses it to the lips; therefore, the instrument only naturally produces every other overtone of the harmonic series. The shape of the bell makes the missing overtones audible. Most notes in the series are slightly out of tune and modern trumpets have slide mechanisms for the first and third valves with which the player can compensate by throwing (extending) or retracting one or both slides, using the left thumb and ring finger for the first and third valve slides respectively. Trumpets can be constructed from other materials, including plastic. == Types == The most common type is the B\u266d trumpet, but A, C, D, E\u266d, E, low F, and G trumpets are also available. The C trumpet is most common in American orchestral playing, where it is used alongside the B\u266d trumpet. Orchestral trumpet players are adept at transposing music at sight, frequently playing music written for the A, B\u266d, D, E\u266d, E, or F trumpet on the C trumpet or B\u266d trumpet. The smallest trumpets are referred to as piccolo trumpets. The most common models are built to play in both B\u266d and A, with separate leadpipes for each key. The tubing in the B\u266d piccolo trumpet is one-half the length of that in a standard B\u266d trumpet making it sound an octave higher. Piccolo trumpets in G, F and C are also manufactured, but are less common. Almost all piccolo trumpets have four valves instead of three\u2014the fourth valve usually lowers the pitch by a fourth, making some lower notes accessible and creating alternate fingerings for certain trills. Maurice Andr\u00e9, H\u00e5kan Hardenberger, David Mason, and Wynton Marsalis are some well-known trumpet players known for their virtuosity on the piccolo trumpet. Trumpets pitched in the key of low G are also called sopranos, or soprano bugles, after their adaptation from military bugles. Traditionally used in drum and bugle corps, sopranos employ either rotary valves or piston valves. The bass trumpet is at the same pitch as a trombone and is usually played by a trombone player, although its music is written in treble clef. Most bass trumpets are pitched in either C or B\u266d. The C bass trumpet sounds an octave lower than written, and the B\u266d bass sounds a major ninth (B\u266d) lower, making them both transposing instruments. The historical slide trumpet was probably first developed in the late 14th century for use in alta cappella wind bands. Deriving from early straight trumpets, the Renaissance slide trumpet was essentially a natural trumpet with a sliding leadpipe. This single slide was awkward, as the entire instrument moved, and the range of the slide was probably no more than a major third. Originals were probably pitched in D, to fit with shawms in D and G, probably at a typical pitch standard near A=466 Hz. No known instruments from this period survive, so the details\u2014and even the existence\u2014of a Renaissance slide trumpet is a matter of debate among scholars. While there is documentation (written and artistic) of its existence, there is also conjecture that its slide would have been impractical.Some slide trumpet designs saw use in England in the 18th century.The pocket trumpet is a compact B\u266d trumpet. The bell is usually smaller than a standard trumpet bell and the tubing is more tightly wound to reduce the instrument size without reducing the total tube length. Its design is not standardized, and the quality of various models varies greatly. It can have a unique warm sound and voice-like articulation. Since many pocket trumpet models suffer from poor design as well as poor manufacturing, the intonation, tone color and dynamic range of such instruments are severely hindered. Professional-standard instruments are, however, available. While they are not a substitute for the full-sized instrument, they can be useful in certain contexts. The jazz musician Don Cherry was renowned for his playing of the pocket instrument. The tubing of the bell section of a herald trumpet is straight, making it long enough to accommodate a hanging banner. This instrument is mostly used for ceremonial events such as parades and fanfares. David Monette designed the flumpet in 1989 for jazz musician Art Farmer. It is a hybrid of a trumpet and a flugelhorn, pitched in B\u266d and using three piston valves.Other variations include rotary-valve, or German, trumpets (which are commonly used in professional German and Austrian orchestras), alto and Baroque trumpets, and the Vienna valve trumpet (primarily used in Viennese brass ensembles and orchestras such as the Vienna Philharmonic and Mnozil Brass). The trumpet is often confused with its close relative the cornet, which has a more conical tubing shape compared to the trumpet's more cylindrical tube. This, along with additional bends in the cornet's tubing, gives the cornet a slightly mellower tone, but the instruments are otherwise nearly identical. They have the same length of tubing and, therefore, the same pitch, so music written for one of them is playable on the other. Another relative, the flugelhorn, has tubing that is even more conical than that of the cornet, and an even mellower tone. It is sometimes supplied with a fourth valve to improve the intonation of some lower notes. == Playing == === Fingering === On any modern trumpet, cornet, or flugelhorn, pressing the valves indicated by the numbers below produces the written notes shown. \"Open\" means all valves up, \"1\" means first valve, \"1\u20132\" means first and second valve simultaneously, and so on. The sounding pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument. Engaging the fourth valve, if present, usually drops any of these pitches by a perfect fourth as well. Within each overtone series, the different pitches are attained by changing the embouchure. Standard fingerings above high C are the same as for the notes an octave below (C\u266f is 1\u20132, D is 1, etc.). Each overtone series on the trumpet begins with the first overtone\u2014the fundamental of each overtone series cannot be produced except as a pedal tone. Notes in parentheses are the sixth overtone, representing a pitch with a frequency of seven times that of the fundamental; while this pitch is close to the note shown, it is flat relative to equal temperament, and use of those fingerings is generally avoided. The fingering schema arises from the length of each valve's tubing (a longer tube produces a lower pitch). Valve \"1\" increases the tubing length enough to lower the pitch by one whole step, valve \"2\" by one half step, and valve \"3\" by one and a half steps. This scheme and the nature of the overtone series create the possibility of alternate fingerings for certain notes. For example, third-space \"C\" can be produced with no valves engaged (standard fingering) or with valves 2\u20133. Also, any note produced with 1\u20132 as its standard fingering can also be produced with valve 3 \u2013 each drops the pitch by 1+1\u20442 steps. Alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages, or to aid in intonation. Extending the third valve slide when using the fingerings 1\u20133 or 1-2-3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation.Some of the partials of the harmonic series that a modern B\u266d trumpet can play for each combination of valves pressed are in tune with 12-tone equal temperament and some are not. == Mutes == Various types of mutes can be placed in or over the bell, which decreases volume and changes timbre. Of all brass instruments, trumpets have the widest selection of mutes: common mutes include the straight mute, cup mute, harmon mute (wah-wah or wow-wow mute, among other names), plunger, bucket mute, and practice mute. When the type of mute is not specified, players generally use a straight mute, the most common type. Jazz, commercial, and show band musicians often use a wider range of mutes than their classical counterparts, and many mutes were invented for jazz orchestrators.Mutes can be made of many materials, including fiberglass, plastic, cardboard, metal, and \"stone lining\", a trade name of the Humes & Berg company. They are often held in place with cork. To better keep the mute in place, players sometimes dampen the cork by blowing warm, moist air on it. The straight mute is conical and constructed of either metal (usually aluminum)\u2014which produces a bright, piercing sound\u2014or another material, which produces a darker, stuffier sound. The cup mute is shaped like a straight mute with an additional, bell-facing cup at the end, and produces a darker tone than a straight mute. The harmon mute is made of metal (usually aluminum or copper) and consists of a \"stem\" inserted into a large chamber. The stem can be extended or removed to produce different timbres, and waving one's hand in front of the mute produces a \"wah-wah\" sound, hence the mute's colloquial name. == Range == Using standard technique, the lowest note is the written F\u266f below middle C. There is no actual limit to how high brass instruments can play, but fingering charts generally go up to the high C two octaves above middle C. Several trumpeters have achieved fame for their proficiency in the extreme high register, among them Maynard Ferguson, Cat Anderson, Dizzy Gillespie, Doc Severinsen, and more recently Wayne Bergeron, Louis Dowdeswell, Thomas Gansch, James Morrison, Jon Faddis and Arturo Sandoval. It is also possible to produce pedal tones below the low F\u266f, which is a device occasionally employed in the contemporary repertoire for the instrument. == Extended technique == Contemporary music for the trumpet makes wide uses of extended trumpet techniques. Flutter tonguing: The trumpeter rolls the tip of the tongue (as if rolling an \"R\" in Spanish) to produce a 'growling like' tone. This technique is widely employed by composers like Berio and Stockhausen. Growling: Simultaneously playing tone and using the back of the tongue to vibrate the uvula, creating a distinct sound. Most trumpet players will use a plunger with this technique to achieve a particular sound heard in a lot of Chicago Jazz of the 1950s. Double tonguing: The player articulates using the syllables ta-ka ta-ka ta-ka. Triple tonguing: The same as double tonguing, but with the syllables ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka. Doodle tongue: The trumpeter tongues as if saying the word doodle. This is a very faint tonguing similar in sound to a valve tremolo. Glissando: Trumpeters can slide between notes by depressing the valves halfway and changing the lip tension. Modern repertoire makes extensive use of this technique. Vibrato: It is often regulated in contemporary repertoire through specific notation. Composers can call for everything from fast, slow or no vibrato to actual rhythmic patterns played with vibrato. Pedal tone: Composers have written notes as low as two-and-a-half octaves below the low F\u266f at the bottom of the standard range. Extreme low pedals are produced by slipping the lower lip out of the mouthpiece. Claude Gordon assigned pedals as part of his trumpet practice routines, that were a systematic expansion on his lessons with Herbert L. Clarke. The technique was pioneered by Bohumir Kryl.Microtones: Composers such as Scelsi and Stockhausen have made wide use of the trumpet's ability to play microtonally. Some instruments feature a fourth valve that provides a quarter-tone step between each note. The jazz musician Ibrahim Maalouf uses such a trumpet, invented by his father to make it possible to play Arab maqams. Valve tremolo: Many notes on the trumpet can be played in several different valve combinations. By alternating between valve combinations on the same note, a tremolo effect can be created. Berio makes extended use of this technique in his Sequenza X. Noises: By hissing, clicking, or breathing through the instrument, the trumpet can be made to resonate in ways that do not sound at all like a trumpet. Noises may require amplification. Preparation: Composers have called for trumpeters to play under water, or with certain slides removed. It is increasingly common for composers to specify all sorts of preparations for trumpet. Extreme preparations involve alternate constructions, such as double bells and extra valves. Split tone: Trumpeters can produce more than one tone simultaneously by vibrating the two lips at different speeds. The interval produced is usually an octave or a fifth. Lip-trill or shake: Also known as \"lip-slurs\". By rapidly varying air speed, but not changing the depressed valves, the pitch can vary quickly between adjacent harmonic partials. Shakes and lip-trills can vary in speed, and in the distance between the partials. However, lip-trills and shakes usually involve the next partial up from the written note. Multi-phonics: Playing a note and \"humming\" a different note simultaneously. For example, sustaining a middle C and humming a major 3rd \"E\" at the same time. Circular breathing: A technique wind players use to produce uninterrupted tone, without pauses for breaths. The player puffs up the cheeks, storing air, then breathes in rapidly through the nose while using the cheeks to continue pushing air outwards. === Instruction and method books === One trumpet method is Jean-Baptiste Arban's Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet (Cornet). Other well-known method books include Technical Studies by Herbert L. Clarke, Grand Method by Louis Saint-Jacome, Daily Drills and Technical Studies by Max Schlossberg, and methods by Ernest S. Williams, Claude Gordon, Charles Colin, James Stamp, and Louis Davidson. A common method book for beginners is the Walter Beeler's Method for the Cornet, and there have been several instruction books written by virtuoso Allen Vizzutti. Merri Franquin wrote a Complete Method for Modern Trumpet, which fell into obscurity for much of the twentieth century until public endorsements by Maurice Andr\u00e9 revived interest in this work. == Players == In early jazz, Louis Armstrong was well known for his virtuosity and his improvisations on the Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings, and his switch from cornet to trumpet is often cited as heralding the trumpet's dominance over the cornet in jazz. Dizzy Gillespie was a gifted improviser with an extremely high (but musical) range, building on the style of Roy Eldridge but adding new layers of harmonic complexity. Gillespie had an enormous impact on virtually every subsequent trumpeter, both by the example of his playing and as a mentor to younger musicians. Miles Davis is widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century\u2014his style was distinctive and widely imitated. Davis' phrasing and sense of space in his solos have been models for generations of jazz musicians. Cat Anderson was a trumpet player who was known for the ability to play extremely high with an even more extreme volume, who played with Duke Ellington's Big Band. Maynard Ferguson came to prominence playing in Stan Kenton's orchestra, before forming his own band in 1957. He was noted for being able to play accurately in a remarkably high register. == Musical pieces == === Solos === Anton Weidinger developed in the 1790s the first successful keyed trumpet, capable of playing all the chromatic notes in its range. Joseph Haydn's Trumpet Concerto was written for him in 1796 and startled contemporary audiences by its novelty, a fact shown off by some stepwise melodies played low in the instrument's range. == In art == == See also == Herald and Trumpet contest Compositions for trumpet Birch trumpet Muted trumpet Wind controller == References == === Notes === === Bibliography === Barclay, R.

International Trumpet Guild, international trumpet players' association with online library of scholarly journal back issues, news, jobs and other trumpet resources.", "summary": "The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet\u2014with the highest register in the brass family\u2014to the bass trumpet, pitched one octave below the standard B\u266d or C trumpet. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 2000 BC. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through slightly separated lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \"buzzing\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B\u266d (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.", "Words": ["Trump"]}, {"title": "Donald Trump", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "content": "Donald John <b>Trump</b> (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. <b>Trump</b> received a Bachelor of Science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, and his father named him president of his real estate business in 1971. <b>Trump</b> renamed it the <b>Trump</b> Organization and reoriented the company toward building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business reversals in the late twentieth century, he successfully launched side ventures that required little capital, mostly by licensing the <b>Trump</b> name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six business bankruptcies. <b>Trump</b> won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He was the first U.S. president with no prior military or government experience. The 2017\u20132019 special counsel investigation established that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to favor Trump's campaign. <b>Trump</b> promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist and many as misogynistic. As president, <b>Trump</b> ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and implemented a policy of family separations for migrants detained at the U.S. border. He weakened environmental protections, rolling back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation about unproven treatments. <b>Trump</b> initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times but made no progress on denuclearization. <b>Trump</b> refused to concede defeat after losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud, and attempted to overturn the results by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of unsuccessful legal challenges, and obstructing the presidential transition. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, which many of them then attacked, resulting in multiple deaths and interrupting the electoral vote count. <b>Trump</b> is the only American president to have been impeached twice. After he tried to pressure Ukraine in 2019 to investigate Biden, he was impeached by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress; he was acquitted by the Senate in February 2020. The House impeached him again in January 2021, for incitement of insurrection, and the Senate acquitted him in February. Scholars and historians rank <b>Trump</b> as one of the worst presidents in American history.Since leaving office, <b>Trump</b> has remained heavily involved in the Republican Party. In November 2022, he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election. In 2023, <b>Trump</b> was indicted in New York on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, in Florida on 40 felony counts related to his handling of classified documents, in Washington, D.C., on four felony counts of conspiracy and obstruction for efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and in Georgia on 19 charges of racketeering and other alleged felonies committed in an effort to overturn the state's 2020 election results. <b>Trump</b> pleaded not guilty to all charges. == Personal life == === Early life === Donald John <b>Trump</b> was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City, the fourth child of Fred Trump, a Bronx-born real estate developer whose parents were German immigrants, and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, an immigrant from Scotland. <b>Trump</b> grew up with older siblings Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth and younger brother Robert in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, and attended the private Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he was enrolled at the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, and, in 1964, he enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics. In 2015, Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen threatened Trump's colleges, high school, and the College Board with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.While in college, <b>Trump</b> obtained four student draft deferments during the Vietnam War era. In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968, a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve. In October 1968, he was classified 1-Y, a conditional medical deferment, and in 1972, he was reclassified 4-F due to bone spurs, permanently disqualifying him from service. === Family === In 1977, <b>Trump</b> married Czech model Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1. They had three children: Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988. The couple divorced in 1990, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples. <b>Trump</b> and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (born 1993), who was raised by Marla in California. In 2005, <b>Trump</b> married Slovenian model Melania Knauss. They have one son, Barron (born 2006). Melania gained U.S. citizenship in 2006. === Religion === <b>Trump</b> went to Sunday school and was confirmed in 1959 at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens. In the 1970s, his parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, which belongs to the Reformed Church in America. The pastor at Marble, Norman Vincent Peale, ministered to the family until his death in 1993. <b>Trump</b> has described him as a mentor. In 2015, the church stated that <b>Trump</b> was not an active member. In 2019, he appointed his personal pastor, televangelist Paula White, to the White House Office of Public Liaison. In 2020, he said he identified as a non-denominational Christian. === Health habits === <b>Trump</b> has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\" but usually does not walk the course. He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes exercise depletes the body's energy \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\". In 2015, Trump's campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that <b>Trump</b> would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\". In 2018, Bornstein said <b>Trump</b> had dictated the contents of the letter and that three <b>Trump</b> agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor's office. === Wealth === In 1982, <b>Trump</b> made the initial Forbes list of wealthy people for holding a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth (equivalent to $606 million in 2022). His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995. After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with the FEC in July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10 billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4 billion in assets and $265 million in liabilities. Forbes estimated his net worth dropped by $1.4 billion between 2015 and 2018. In their 2021 billionaires ranking, Trump's net worth was estimated to be $2.4 billion (1,299th in the world).Journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported that <b>Trump</b> called him in 1984, pretending to be a fictional <b>Trump</b> Organization official named \"John Barron\". Greenberg said that Trump, speaking as \"Barron\", falsely asserted that he owned more than 90 percent of his father's business to get a higher ranking for himself on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984.Trump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest. He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413 million (2018 dollars adjusted for inflation) from his father's company. In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance started an investigation. His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets. Forbes estimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5 billion in 2015 to $3.1 billion in 2017 and his product-licensing income from $23 million to $3 million.Contrary to his claims of financial health and business acumen, Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250 million each year, were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7 million (equivalent to $1.76 billion in 2022).In 2020, the New York Times obtained Trump's tax information extending over two decades. Its reporters found that <b>Trump</b> reported losses of hundreds of millions of dollars and had, since 2010, deferred declaring $287 million in forgiven debt as taxable income. His income mainly came from his share in The Apprentice and businesses in which he was a minority partner, and his losses mainly from majority-owned businesses. Much income was in tax credits for his losses, which let him avoid annual income tax payments or lower them to $750. During the 2010s, <b>Trump</b> balanced his businesses' losses by selling and borrowing against assets, including a $100 million mortgage on <b>Trump</b> Tower (due in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200 million in stocks and bonds. He personally guaranteed $421 million in debt, most of which is due by 2024.As of October 2021, <b>Trump</b> had over $1.3 billion in total debts, much of which is secured by his assets. In 2020, he owed $640 million to banks and trust organizations, including Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, and approximately $450 million to unknown creditors. The value of his assets exceeds his debt. == Business career == === Real estate === Starting in 1968, <b>Trump</b> was employed at his father's real estate company, <b>Trump</b> Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs. In 1971, he became president of the company and began using the <b>Trump</b> Organization as an umbrella brand. Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses, the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the <b>Trump</b> Hotels & Casino Resorts company. ==== Manhattan developments ==== <b>Trump</b> attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for <b>Trump</b> by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan. The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel, and that same year, <b>Trump</b> obtained rights to develop <b>Trump</b> Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The building houses the headquarters of the <b>Trump</b> Corporation and Trump's PAC and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.In 1988, <b>Trump</b> acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of sixteen banks. The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property. In 1995, <b>Trump</b> defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a humiliating restructuring that allowed <b>Trump</b> to avoid personal bankruptcy. The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they \"all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead.\"In 1996, <b>Trump</b> acquired the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the <b>Trump</b> Building, and renovated it. In the early 1990s, <b>Trump</b> won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, <b>Trump</b> sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who were able to finance the project's completion, Riverside South. ==== Atlantic City casinos ==== In 1984, <b>Trump</b> opened Harrah's at <b>Trump</b> Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation. It was unprofitable, and <b>Trump</b> paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control. In 1985, <b>Trump</b> bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it <b>Trump</b> Castle. His wife Ivana managed it until 1988. Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the <b>Trump</b> Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990. <b>Trump</b> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, <b>Trump</b> gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance. To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the <b>Trump</b> Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the <b>Trump</b> Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.In 1995, <b>Trump</b> founded <b>Trump</b> Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the <b>Trump</b> Plaza. THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the <b>Trump</b> Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving <b>Trump</b> with 10 percent ownership. He remained chairman until 2009. ==== Mar-a-Lago ==== In 1985, <b>Trump</b> acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence. In 2019, <b>Trump</b> declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence. ==== Golf courses ==== The <b>Trump</b> Organization began building and buying golf courses in 1999. It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide.Trump visited a <b>Trump</b> Organization property on 428 (nearly one in three) of the 1,461 days of his presidency and is estimated to have played 261 rounds of golf, one every 5.6 days. === Licensing of the <b>Trump</b> brand === The <b>Trump</b> name has been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings. According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, and they have generated at least $59 million in revenue for his companies. By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name. === Side ventures === In September 1983, <b>Trump</b> purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule (when they competed with the NFL for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit against the organization.Trump's businesses have hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall, adjacent to and promoted as taking place at the <b>Trump</b> Plaza in Atlantic City. In 1989 and 1990, <b>Trump</b> lent his name to the Tour de <b>Trump</b> cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.From 1986 to 1988, <b>Trump</b> purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit, leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail. The New York Times found that <b>Trump</b> initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\".In 1988, <b>Trump</b> purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $940 million in 2022) in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline <b>Trump</b> Shuttle and operated it until 1992. <b>Trump</b> defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks. The airline was eventually sold to US Airways. In 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to <b>Trump</b> Management with markups of 20\u201350 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups. The increased costs were used as justification to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units.From 1996 to 2015, <b>Trump</b> owned all or part of the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002. In 2007, <b>Trump</b> received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe. NBC and Univision dropped the pageants from their broadcasting lineups in June 2015. ==== <b>Trump</b> University ==== In 2004, <b>Trump</b> co-founded <b>Trump</b> University, a company that sold real estate training courses priced from $1,500 to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the <b>Trump</b> Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against <b>Trump</b> University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. In addition, two class actions were filed in federal court against <b>Trump</b> and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that <b>Trump</b> University had defrauded or lied to its students. Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, <b>Trump</b> agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases. === Foundation === The Donald J. <b>Trump</b> Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988. In the foundation's final years, its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014. The foundation gave to health-care- and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion. Also in 2016, the New York Attorney General determined the foundation to be in violation of state law for soliciting donations and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York. Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties. In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities. In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered <b>Trump</b> to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign. === Legal affairs and bankruptcies === Roy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer, and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s. According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship. In 1973, Cohn helped <b>Trump</b> countersue the United States government for $100 million (equivalent to $659 million in 2022) over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case went forward, ultimately resulting in a settlement. In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things. Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.According to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, <b>Trump</b> and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions. While <b>Trump</b> has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009. They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced Trump's shares in the properties.During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent <b>Trump</b> $4 billion. After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him. After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with <b>Trump</b> or his company in the future. == Media career == === Books === Using ghostwriters, <b>Trump</b> has produced up to 19 books on business, financial, or political topics under his name. His first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller. While <b>Trump</b> was credited as co-author, the entire book was written by Tony Schwartz. According to The New Yorker, \"The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, making him an emblem of the successful tycoon.\" <b>Trump</b> has called the volume his second favorite book, after the Bible. === Film and television === <b>Trump</b> made cameo appearances in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001.Trump had a sporadic relationship with the professional wrestling promotion WWE since the late 1980s. He appeared at WrestleMania 23 in 2007 and was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013. Starting in the 1990s, <b>Trump</b> was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show. He also had his own short-form talk radio program called Trumped! (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008. From 2011 until 2015, he was a weekly unpaid guest commentator on Fox & Friends.From 2004 to 2015, <b>Trump</b> was co-producer and host of reality shows The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice. <b>Trump</b> played a flattering, highly fictionalized version of himself as a superrich and successful chief executive who eliminated contestants with the catchphrase \"You're fired\". The shows remade his image for millions of viewers nationwide. With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million which he invested in largely unprofitable businesses.In February 2021, <b>Trump</b> resigned from the Screen Actors Guild he had been a member of since 1989 rather than face a disciplinary committee hearing for inciting the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the U.S. Capitol and for his \"reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists\". Two days later, the union permanently barred him from readmission. == Political career == Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in 1987; a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999; a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.In 1987, <b>Trump</b> placed full-page advertisements in three major newspapers, expressing his views on foreign policy and on how to eliminate the federal budget deficit. He ruled out running for local office but not for the presidency. In 1988, he approached Lee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee George H. W. Bush's running mate. Bush found the request \"strange and unbelievable\". === Presidential campaigns (2000\u20132016) === In 2000, <b>Trump</b> ran in the California and Michigan primaries for nomination as the Reform Party candidate for the 2000 United States presidential election but withdrew from the race in February 2000. A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed <b>Trump</b> with seven percent support. In 2011, <b>Trump</b> speculated about running against President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, making his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011 and giving speeches in early primary states. In May 2011, he announced he would not run, and he endorsed Mitt Romney in February 2012. Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time. ==== 2016 presidential campaign ==== Trump's fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries. He adopted the phrase \"truthful hyperbole\", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style. His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive, and a record number of them were false. The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as <b>Trump</b> has.\" <b>Trump</b> said he disdained political correctness and frequently made claims of media bias. <b>Trump</b> announced his candidacy in June 2015. His campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls. He became the front-runner in March 2016 and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.Hillary Clinton led <b>Trump</b> in national polling averages throughout the campaign, but, in early July, her lead narrowed. In mid-July <b>Trump</b> selected Indiana governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate, and the two were officially nominated at the 2016 Republican National Convention. <b>Trump</b> and Clinton faced off in three presidential debates in September and October 2016. <b>Trump</b> twice refused to say whether he would accept the result of the election. ===== Campaign rhetoric and political positions ===== Trump's political positions and rhetoric were right-wing populist. Politico described them as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\", quoting a health-care policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute as saying that his political positions were \"a total random assortment of whatever plays publicly\". NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.Trump questioned the need for NATO and espoused views that were described as isolationist, non-interventionist, and protectionist. His campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.\u2013China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. Other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. He described NATO as \"obsolete\".Trump helped bring far-right fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream. <b>Trump</b> was slow to disavow an endorsement from David Duke after he was questioned about it during a CNN interview on February 28, 2016. Duke enthusiastically supported <b>Trump</b> and said he and like-minded people voted for <b>Trump</b> because of his promises to \"take our country back\". In August 2016, <b>Trump</b> hired Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News\u2014described by Bannon as \"the platform for the alt-right\"\u2014as his campaign CEO. The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported Trump's candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration. ===== Financial disclosures ===== Trump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million. <b>Trump</b> did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office. He said his tax returns were being audited, and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them. After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by <b>Trump</b> to the United States Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that <b>Trump</b> had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. ===== Election to the presidency ===== On November 8, 2016, <b>Trump</b> received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton, though, after elector defections on both sides, the official count was ultimately 304 to 227. <b>Trump</b> received nearly 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote. <b>Trump</b> also became the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president. Trump's victory was a political upset. Polls had consistently shown Clinton with a nationwide\u2014though diminishing\u2014lead, as well as an advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated, while Clinton's had been overestimated.Trump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, states which had been considered a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of an undivided Republican government\u2014a Republican White House combined with Republican control of both chambers of Congress. Trump's election victory sparked protests in major U.S. cities in the days following the election. On the day after Trump's inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including an estimated half million in Washington, D.C., protested against <b>Trump</b> in the Women's Marches. == Presidency (2017\u20132021) == === Early actions === <b>Trump</b> was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders, which authorized: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City policy, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner became his assistant and senior advisor, respectively. === Conflicts of interest === Before being inaugurated, <b>Trump</b> moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and a business associate. Though he said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the <b>Trump</b> Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic. <b>Trump</b> continued to profit from his businesses and to know how his administration's policies affected his businesses.He was sued for violating the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, marking the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated. One case was dismissed in lower court. Two were dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court as moot after the end of Trump's term. === Domestic policy === ==== Economy ==== <b>Trump</b> took office at the height of the longest economic expansion in American history, which began in June 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began.In December 2017, <b>Trump</b> signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The bill had been passed by both Republican-controlled chambers of Congress without any Democratic votes. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals, with business tax cuts to be permanent and individual tax cuts set to expire after 2025, and eliminated the penalty associated with Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. The <b>Trump</b> administration claimed that the act would either increase tax revenues or pay for itself by prompting economic growth. Instead, revenues in 2018 were 7.6 percent lower than projected.Despite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, <b>Trump</b> approved large increases in government spending and the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019. Under Trump, the U.S. national debt increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75 trillion by the end of his term, and the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio hit a post-World War II high. <b>Trump</b> also failed to deliver the $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.Trump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3 million people. ==== Climate change, environment, and energy ==== <b>Trump</b> rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change. In June 2017, <b>Trump</b> announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.Trump aimed to boost the production and exports of fossil fuels. Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline. <b>Trump</b> rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge. Trump's actions while president have been called \"a very aggressive attempt to rewrite our laws and reinterpret the meaning of environmental protections\". ==== Deregulation ==== In January 2017, <b>Trump</b> signed Executive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies \"identify\" two existing regulations for elimination, though it did not require elimination. He dismantled many federal regulations on health, labor, and the environment, among other topics. <b>Trump</b> signed 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions repealing federal regulations, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns. During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations, often \"after requests by the regulated industries\". The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of Trump's proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation. ==== Health care ==== During his campaign, <b>Trump</b> vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders 13765 and 13813. <b>Trump</b> expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment. <b>Trump</b> falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA. In June 2018, the <b>Trump</b> administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the ACA unconstitutional. If they had succeeded, it would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans. During the 2016 campaign, <b>Trump</b> promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020, he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.In response to the opioid epidemic, <b>Trump</b> signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a record 50,052 deaths in 2019. ==== Social issues ==== <b>Trump</b> barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds. He said he supported \"traditional marriage\" but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue. In March 2017, his administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against discrimination of LGBT people. Trump's attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections for transgender patients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after the Supreme Court's ruling in July had extended employees' civil rights protections to gender identity and sexual orientation.Trump has said he is opposed to gun control in general, although his views have shifted over time. After several mass shootings during his term, he said he would propose legislation to curtail gun violence, but he abandoned that effort in November 2019. His administration took an anti-marijuana position, revoking Obama-era policies that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.Trump is a long-time advocate of capital punishment. Under his administration, the federal government executed 13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined and after a 17-year moratorium. In 2016, <b>Trump</b> said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such as waterboarding but later appeared to recant this due to the opposition of Defense Secretary James Mattis. === Pardons and commutations === <b>Trump</b> granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.From 2017 to 2019, he pardoned, amongst others, former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who was convicted of taking classified photographs of classified areas inside a submarine; and right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza. Following a request by celebrity Kim Kardashian, <b>Trump</b> commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who had been convicted of drug trafficking. <b>Trump</b> also pardoned or reversed the sentences of three American servicemen convicted or accused of committing war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq.In November and December 2020, <b>Trump</b> pardoned four Blackwater private security contractors convicted of killing Iraqi civilians in the 2007 Nisour Square massacre; white-collar criminals Michael Milken and Bernard Kerik; daughter Ivanka's father-in-law Charles Kushner; and five people convicted as a result of investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections. Among them were Michael Flynn; Roger Stone, whose 40-month sentence for lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstruction he had already commuted in July; and Paul Manafort.In his last full day in office, <b>Trump</b> granted 73 pardons, including to Steve Bannon and <b>Trump</b> fundraiser Elliott Broidy, and commuted 70 sentences. === Lafayette Square protester removal and photo op === On June 1, 2020, federal law-enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, pepper spray projectiles, stun grenades, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd of protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House. <b>Trump</b> then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church, where protesters had set a small fire the night before; he posed for photographs holding a Bible, with senior administration officials later joining him in photos. <b>Trump</b> said on June 3 that the protesters were cleared because \"they tried to burn down the church [on May 31] and almost succeeded\", describing the church as \"badly hurt\".Religious leaders condemned the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself. Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned Trump's proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters. === Immigration === Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a wall on the Mexico\u2013United States border to restrict illegal movement and vowed Mexico would pay for it. He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the United States, and criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing \"anchor babies\". As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gang MS-13, though available research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans.Trump attempted to drastically escalate immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.From 2018 onward, <b>Trump</b> deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border to stop most Central American migrants from seeking U.S. asylum. In 2020, his administration widened the public charge rule to further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency via green cards. <b>Trump</b> reduced the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. to record lows. When <b>Trump</b> took office, the annual limit was 110,000; <b>Trump</b> set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year. Additional restrictions implemented by the <b>Trump</b> administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted compared to the allowed limits. ==== Travel ban ==== Following the 2015 San Bernardino attack, <b>Trump</b> proposed to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented. He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".On January 27, 2017, <b>Trump</b> signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning, causing confusion and chaos at airports. Protests against the ban began at airports the next day. Legal challenges to the order resulted in nationwide preliminary injunctions. A March 6 revised order, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, again was blocked by federal judges in three states. In a decision in June 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\".The temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials. After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4, 2017, and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling. ==== Family separation at border ==== The <b>Trump</b> administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017. In April 2018, the <b>Trump</b> administration announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy whereby every adult suspected of illegal entry would be criminally prosecuted. This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors. Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration.The policy of family separations was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage. <b>Trump</b> falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration's policy.Although <b>Trump</b> originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he acceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order on June 20, 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" doing so would pose a risk to the child. On June 26, 2018, Judge Dana Sabraw concluded that the <b>Trump</b> administration had \"no system in place to keep track of\" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification; Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances. After the federal-court order, the <b>Trump</b> administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; the ACLU contended that the <b>Trump</b> administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation. ==== <b>Trump</b> wall and government shutdown ==== One of Trump's central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it. By the end of his term, the U.S. had built \"40 miles [64 km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53 km] of secondary wall\" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587 km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.In 2018, <b>Trump</b> refused to sign any appropriations bill from Congress unless it allocated $5.6 billion in funds for the border wall, resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. Around 800,000 government employees were furloughed or worked without pay. <b>Trump</b> and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers but no funds for the wall. The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3 billion to the economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office. About half of those polled blamed <b>Trump</b> for the shutdown, and Trump's approval ratings dropped.To prevent another imminent shutdown in February 2019, Congress passed and <b>Trump</b> signed a funding bill that included $1.375 billion for 55 miles (89 km) of bollard border fencing. <b>Trump</b> also declared a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States, intending to divert $6.1 billion of funds Congress had allocated to other purposes. <b>Trump</b> vetoed a joint resolution to overturn the declaration, and the Senate voted against a veto override. Legal challenges to the diversion of $2.5 billion originally meant for the Department of Defense's drug interdiction efforts and $3.6 billion originally meant for military construction were unsuccessful. === Foreign policy === <b>Trump</b> described himself as a \"nationalist\" and his foreign policy as \"America First\". His foreign policy was marked by praise and support of populist, neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments. Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure included unpredictability and uncertainty, a lack of a consistent foreign policy, and strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies. He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from the alliance. ==== Trade ==== <b>Trump</b> withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S. While <b>Trump</b> said that import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China. Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large trade deficits, the trade deficit in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, \"was the largest monthly deficit since July 2008\". Following a 2017\u20132018 renegotiation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA. ==== Russia ==== The <b>Trump</b> administration, according to Reuters, \"water[ed] down the toughest penalties the U.S. had imposed on Russian entities\" after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. <b>Trump</b> withdrew the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian non-compliance, and supported a potential return of Russia to the G7.Trump repeatedly praised and rarely criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin but opposed some actions of the Russian government. After he met Putin at the Helsinki Summit in July 2018, <b>Trump</b> drew bipartisan criticism for accepting Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies. <b>Trump</b> did not discuss alleged Russian bounties offered to Taliban fighters for attacking American soldiers in Afghanistan with Putin, saying both that he doubted the intelligence and that he was not briefed on it. ==== China ==== Before and during his presidency, <b>Trump</b> repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S. As president, <b>Trump</b> launched a trade war against China that was widely characterized as a failure, sanctioned Huawei for its alleged ties to Iran, significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars, and classified China as a currency manipulator. <b>Trump</b> also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise of Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, which was attributed to trade war negotiations with the leader. After initially praising China for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, he began a campaign of criticism over its response starting in March 2020.Trump said he resisted punishing China for its human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the northwestern Xinjiang region for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations. In July 2020, the <b>Trump</b> administration imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, in response to expanded mass detention camps holding more than a million of the country's Uyghur Muslim ethnic minority. ==== North Korea ==== In 2017, when North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat, <b>Trump</b> escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\". In 2017, <b>Trump</b> declared that he wanted North Korea's \"complete denuclearization\", and engaged in name-calling with leader Kim Jong Un.After this period of tension, <b>Trump</b> and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship. <b>Trump</b> met Kim three times: in Singapore in 2018, in Hanoi in 2019, and in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in 2019. <b>Trump</b> became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader or to set foot on North Korean soil. <b>Trump</b> also lifted some U.S. sanctions against North Korea.However, no denuclearization agreement was reached, and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day. While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. ==== Afghanistan ==== U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later, reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan. In February 2020, the <b>Trump</b> administration signed a conditional peace agreement with the Taliban, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months \"contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies\" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000 Taliban imprisoned by the Afghan government. By the end of Trump's term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integrating Al-Qaeda members into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500. ==== Israel ==== <b>Trump</b> supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Under Trump, the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, leading to international condemnation including from the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union, and the Arab League. ==== Saudi Arabia ==== <b>Trump</b> actively supported the Saudi Arabian\u2013led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and in 2017 signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, In 2018, the U.S. provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention. Following the 2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed on Iran, <b>Trump</b> approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, two Patriot batteries, and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. ==== Syria ==== <b>Trump</b> ordered missile strikes in April 2017 and in April 2018 against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun and Douma chemical attacks, respectively.In December 2018, <b>Trump</b> declared \"we have won against ISIS\", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria. The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling his decision an abandonment of the U.S.'s Kurdish allies who played a key role in fighting ISIS. One week after his announcement, <b>Trump</b> said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria. In October 2019, after <b>Trump</b> spoke to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area and Turkey invaded northern Syria, attacking and displacing American-allied Kurds in the area. Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, condemned Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for \"abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe\". ==== Iran ==== In May 2018, <b>Trump</b> withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program. Analysts determined that, after the United States's withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.On January 1, 2020, <b>Trump</b> ordered a U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who had planned nearly every significant operation by Iranian forces over the past two decades. <b>Trump</b> threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites if Iran retaliated. On January 8, Iran retaliated with ballistic missile strikes against two U.S. airbases in Iraq, leveling the bases. Dozens of soldiers sustained traumatic brain injuries. Their injuries were downplayed by Trump, and they were initially denied Purple Hearts and the special benefits accorded to its recipients. On the same day, amid the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, Iran accidentally shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 after takeoff from Tehran airport.In August 2020, the <b>Trump</b> administration unsuccessfully attempted to trigger a mechanism that was part of the agreement that would have led to the return of U.N. sanctions against Iran. === Personnel === The <b>Trump</b> administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned. As of early July 2018, 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left and 141 staffers had left in the previous year. Both figures set a record for recent presidents\u2014more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years. Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Close personal aides to <b>Trump</b> including Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee, and Keith Schiller quit or were forced out. Some, including Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts. <b>Trump</b> publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.Trump had four White House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several. Reince Priebus was replaced after seven months by retired Marine general John F. Kelly. Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and <b>Trump</b> subsequently disparaged him. Kelly was succeeded by Mick Mulvaney as acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 by Mark Meadows.On May 9, 2017, <b>Trump</b> dismissed FBI director James Comey. While initially attributing this action to Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails, <b>Trump</b> said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey's roles in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier. At a private conversation in February, <b>Trump</b> said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn. In March and April, <b>Trump</b> asked Comey to \"lift the cloud impairing his ability to act\" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.Turnover was relatively high within the <b>Trump</b> Cabinet. <b>Trump</b> lost three of his 15 original cabinet members within his first year. Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee. By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61 percent) and <b>Trump</b> had no nominee for 264 (37 percent). === Judiciary === <b>Trump</b> appointed 226 Article III judges, including 54 to the courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Trump's Supreme Court nominees were noted as having politically shifted the Supreme Court to the right. In the 2016 campaign, <b>Trump</b> pledged that Roe v. Wade would be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and provided the opportunity to appoint two or three pro-life justices. <b>Trump</b> later took credit when Roe was overturned in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. Trump's attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of Trump's statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary. === COVID-19 pandemic === In December 2019, COVID-19 erupted in Wuhan, China; the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread worldwide within weeks. The first confirmed case in the U.S. was reported on January 20, 2020. The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar on January 31, 2020.Trump's public statements on COVID-19 were at odds with his private statements. In February 2020 <b>Trump</b> publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly than influenza, was \"very much under control\", and would soon be over. At the same time he acknowledged the opposite in a private conversation with Bob Woodward. In March 2020, <b>Trump</b> privately told Woodward that he was deliberately \"playing it down\" in public so as not to create panic. ==== Initial response ==== <b>Trump</b> was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the threat and ignoring persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar. Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak, and largely ignored the danger. By mid-March, most global financial markets had severely contracted in response to the emerging pandemic.On March 6, <b>Trump</b> signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and <b>Trump</b> announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March 13. That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak \"horrible\" but \"a temporary moment\" and saying there was no financial crisis. On March 13, he declared a national emergency, freeing up federal resources. <b>Trump</b> falsely claimed that \"anybody that wants a test can get a test\", despite the availability of tests being severely limited.In September 2019, the <b>Trump</b> administration terminated United States Agency for International Development's PREDICT program, a $200 million epidemiological research program initiated in 2009 to provide early warning of pandemics abroad. The program trained scientists in sixty foreign laboratories to detect and respond to viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. One such laboratory was the Wuhan lab that first identified the virus that causes COVID-19. After revival in April 2020, the program was given two 6-month extensions to help fight COVID-19 in the U.S. and other countries.On April 22, <b>Trump</b> signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration to the United States. In late spring and early summer, with infections and death counts continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states for the growing pandemic, rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the course of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership. ==== White House Coronavirus Task Force ==== <b>Trump</b> established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29, 2020. Beginning in mid-March, <b>Trump</b> held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials, sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments. <b>Trump</b> was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press. On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur. His repeated use of the terms \"Chinese virus\" and \"China virus\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, <b>Trump</b> refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which <b>Trump</b> suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19; the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.In early May, <b>Trump</b> proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, <b>Trump</b> said the task force would \"indefinitely\" continue. By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced. ==== World Health Organization ==== Prior to the pandemic, <b>Trump</b> criticized the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid. His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half. In May and April, <b>Trump</b> accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus\" and alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic. He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization. Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic. In July 2020, <b>Trump</b> announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021. The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \"short-sighted\", \"senseless\", and \"dangerous\". ==== Testing ==== In June and July, <b>Trump</b> said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \"makes us look bad\". The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be \"quickly identified and tested\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus. In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under <b>Trump</b> administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists. The day after this political interference was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested. ==== Pressure to abandon pandemic mitigation measures ==== In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic; <b>Trump</b> encouraged the protests on Twitter, even though the targeted states did not meet the <b>Trump</b> administration's own guidelines for reopening. In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's plan to reopen some nonessential businesses. Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the country's economy.Trump often refused to wear a face mask at public events, contrary to his own administration's April 2020 guidance that Americans should wear masks in public and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus. By June, <b>Trump</b> had said masks were a \"double-edged sword\"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally. Trump's contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.Despite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, <b>Trump</b> largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are \"totally harmless\". He also began insisting that all states should open schools to in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases. ==== Political pressure on health agencies ==== <b>Trump</b> repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored, such as approving unproven treatments or speeding up the approval of vaccines. <b>Trump</b> administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication. <b>Trump</b> alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \"deep state\" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically. ==== Outbreak at the White House ==== On October 2, 2020, <b>Trump</b> tweeted that he had tested positive for COVID-19. His wife, their son Barron, and numerous staff members and visitors also became infected.Later that day <b>Trump</b> was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, reportedly due to labored breathing and a fever. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October 5, still struggling with the disease. During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus. In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case of the disease. ==== Effects on the 2020 presidential campaign ==== By July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue for the 2020 presidential election. Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue of the election. Polls suggested voters blamed <b>Trump</b> for his pandemic response and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an Ipsos/ABC News poll indicating 65 percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response. In the final months of the campaign, <b>Trump</b> repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was \"rounding the turn\" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths. A few days before the November 3 election, the United States reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time. === Investigations === After he assumed office, <b>Trump</b> was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation. There were 30 investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.In April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. <b>Trump</b> then sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures. In May, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena, and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply. Trump's attorneys appealed the rulings. In September 2022, the committee and <b>Trump</b> agreed to a settlement about Mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents. ==== Hush money payments ==== During the 2016 presidential election campaign, American Media, Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer, and a company set up by Cohen paid Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with <b>Trump</b> between 2006 and 2007. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of <b>Trump</b> to influence the presidential election. <b>Trump</b> denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017. Federal prosecutors asserted that <b>Trump</b> had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014. Court documents showed that the FBI believed <b>Trump</b> was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016. Federal prosecutors closed the investigation in 2019, but the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the <b>Trump</b> Organization and AMI for records related to the payments and <b>Trump</b> and the <b>Trump</b> Organization for eight years of tax returns. In November 2022, The New York Times reported that Manhattan prosecutors were \"newly optimistic about building a case\" against Trump. ==== Russian election interference ==== In January 2017, American intelligence agencies\u2014the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence\u2014jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump. In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress, \"[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the <b>Trump</b> campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\" Many suspicious links between <b>Trump</b> associates and Russian officials and spies were discovered and the relationships between Russians and \"team Trump\" were widely reported by the press.Manafort, one of Trump's campaign managers, worked from December 2004 to February 2010 to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency. Other <b>Trump</b> associates, including Flynn and Stone, were connected to Russian officials. Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump. Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election. On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence. <b>Trump</b> told Kislyak and Sergei Lavrov in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.Trump and his allies promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election\u2014which was also promoted by Russia to frame Ukraine. After the Democratic National Committee was hacked, <b>Trump</b> first claimed it withheld \"its server\" from the FBI (in actuality there were more than 140 servers, of which digital copies were given to the FBI); second, that CrowdStrike, the company that investigated the servers, was Ukraine-based and Ukrainian-owned (in actuality, CrowdStrike is U.S.-based, with the largest owners being American companies); and third that \"the server\" was hidden in Ukraine. Members of the <b>Trump</b> administration spoke out against the conspiracy theories. ==== FBI Crossfire Hurricane and 2017 counterintelligence investigations ==== In July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamed Crossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the <b>Trump</b> campaign. After <b>Trump</b> fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia. Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation, but deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ended the investigation into Trump's direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that Mueller would pursue the matter. ==== Mueller investigation ==== In May 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, special counsel for the Department of Justice (DOJ), ordering him to \"examine 'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government' and the <b>Trump</b> campaign\". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters \"in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference\". The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice and the <b>Trump</b> campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China. <b>Trump</b> sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.In March 2019, Mueller concluded his investigation and gave his report to Attorney General William Barr. Two days later, Barr sent a letter to Congress purporting to summarize the report's main conclusions. A federal court, as well as Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation's conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public. <b>Trump</b> repeatedly and falsely claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not exonerate him.A redacted version of the report was publicly released in April 2019. It found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's. Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the <b>Trump</b> campaign\", the report found that the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that <b>Trump</b> campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference. The report revealed sweeping Russian interference and detailed how <b>Trump</b> and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing \"[they] would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\".The report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by <b>Trump</b> but did not make a \"traditional prosecutorial judgment\" on whether <b>Trump</b> broke the law, suggesting that Congress should make such a determination. Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\" as an Office of Legal Counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted, and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court. The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\". The House of Representatives subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.Several <b>Trump</b> associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller's investigation and related cases, including Manafort, convicted on eight felony counts, deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, foreign policy advisor Papadopoulos, and Flynn. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a <b>Trump</b> Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as \"Individual-1\" in the court documents. In February 2020, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering regarding his attempts to learn more about hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 election. The sentencing judge said Stone \"was prosecuted for covering up for the president\". === First impeachment === In August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between <b>Trump</b> and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which <b>Trump</b> had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son Hunter. The whistleblower said that the White House had attempted to cover up the incident and that the call was part of a wider campaign by the <b>Trump</b> administration and <b>Trump</b> attorney Rudy Giuliani that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24. <b>Trump</b> then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision. On September 25, the <b>Trump</b> administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, <b>Trump</b> asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr. The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election. In October, William B. Taylor Jr., the charg\u00e9 d'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by <b>Trump</b> and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment investigating the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of Congress. After debate, the House of Representatives impeached <b>Trump</b> on both articles on December 18. ==== Impeachment trial in the Senate ==== During the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers presented their case for three days. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution's impeachment process. Responding over the next three days, Trump's lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said <b>Trump</b> had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress. They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because <b>Trump</b> was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.On January 31, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents; 51 Republicans formed the majority for this vote. The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.Trump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority, 52\u201348 on abuse of power and 53\u201347 on obstruction of Congress. Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican who voted to convict <b>Trump</b> on one charge, the abuse of power. Following his acquittal, <b>Trump</b> fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal. === 2020 presidential campaign === Breaking with precedent, <b>Trump</b> filed to run for a second term with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency. He held his first re-election rally less than a month after taking office and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020.In his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5 million and began 2019 with $19.3 million in cash. By July 2020, the <b>Trump</b> campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1 billion and spent $800 million, losing their cash advantage over Biden. The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.Trump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won the presidency. <b>Trump</b> repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions and shifted to appeals to racism. === 2020 presidential election === Starting in spring 2020, <b>Trump</b> began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud. In July, <b>Trump</b> raised the idea of delaying the election. When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, <b>Trump</b> blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail. He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.Biden won the election on November 3, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent) and 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232. ==== False claims of voting fraud, attempt to prevent presidential transition ==== At 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, <b>Trump</b> declared victory. After Biden was projected the winner days later, <b>Trump</b> stated that \"this election is far from over\" and baselessly alleged election fraud. <b>Trump</b> and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by <b>Trump</b> himself, finding no factual or legal basis. Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials. After Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, <b>Trump</b> dismissed him on November 17. On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case from the Texas attorney general that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.Trump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election. He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden's presidential transition. After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team. <b>Trump</b> still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.The Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14. From November to January, <b>Trump</b> repeatedly sought help to overturn the results of the election, personally pressuring various Republican local and state office-holders, Republican state and federal legislators, the Justice Department, and Vice President Pence, urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result. On February 10, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.Trump did not attend Biden's inauguration, leaving Washington for Florida hours before. ==== Concern about a possible coup attempt or military action ==== In December 2020, Newsweek reported the Pentagon was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what they would do if <b>Trump</b> decided to declare martial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role to play in the outcome of elections.When <b>Trump</b> moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and CIA director Gina Haspel became concerned about the threat of a possible coup attempt or military action against China or Iran. Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons, and he instructed Haspel and NSA director Paul Nakasone to monitor developments closely. ==== January 6 Capitol attack ==== On January 6, 2021, while congressional certification of the presidential election results was taking place in the United States Capitol, <b>Trump</b> held a noon rally at the Ellipse, Washington, D.C.. He called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol to \"show strength\" and \"fight like hell\". Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. Around 2:15 p.m. the mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress. During the violence, <b>Trump</b> watched TV and posted messages on Twitter without asking the rioters to disperse. At 6 p.m., <b>Trump</b> tweeted that the rioters should \"go home with love & in peace\", calling them \"great patriots\" and \"very special\" and repeating that the election was stolen from him. After the mob was removed from the Capitol, Congress reconvened and confirmed the Biden election win in the early hours of the following morning. According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died.In March 2023, <b>Trump</b> collaborated with incarcerated rioters on a song to benefit the prisoners, and, in June, he said that, if elected, he would pardon a large number of them. ==== Second impeachment ==== On January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging <b>Trump</b> with incitement of insurrection against the U.S. government was introduced to the House. The House voted 232\u2013197 to impeach <b>Trump</b> on January 13, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice. Ten Republicans voted for the impeachment\u2014the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.On February 13, following a five-day Senate trial, <b>Trump</b> was acquitted when the Senate voted 57\u201343 for conviction, falling ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president. Most Republicans voted to acquit Trump, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (Trump had left office on January 20; the Senate voted 56\u201344 the trial was constitutional); included in the latter group was Mitch McConnell. == Post-presidency (2021\u2013present) == At the end of his term, <b>Trump</b> went to live at his Mar-a-Lago club. As provided for by the Former Presidents Act, he established an office there to handle his post-presidential activities.Trump's false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the \"big lie\" in the press and by his critics. In May 2021, <b>Trump</b> and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself. The Republican Party used Trump's false election narrative to justify the imposition of new voting restrictions in its favor. As late as July 2022, <b>Trump</b> was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the 2020 election by rescinding the state's electoral votes for Biden.Trump resumed his campaign-style rallies with an 85-minute speech at the annual North Carolina Republican Party convention on June 6, 2021. On June 26, he held his first public rally since the January 6 rally that preceded the riot at the Capitol.Unlike other former presidents, <b>Trump</b> continued to dominate his party; he has been compared to a modern-day party boss. He continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself, hinted at a third candidacy, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on the people in charge of elections and how elections are run. In the 2022 midterm elections he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices, most of whom supported his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. A majority of candidates endorsed by him won in Republican primary elections.Trump registered a new company in February 2021. <b>Trump</b> Media & Technology Group (TMTG) was formed for providing \"social networking services\" to \"customers in the United States\". In October 2021, <b>Trump</b> announced the planned merger of TMTG with Digital World Acquisition, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). A main backer of the SPAC is China-based financier ARC Group, who was reportedly involved in setting up the proposed merger. The transaction is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.In February 2022, TMTG launched Truth Social, a Twitter-like social-media platform. As of March 2023, <b>Trump</b> Media, which had taken $8 million from Russia-connected entities, was being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible money laundering. === Investigations, criminal charges, civil lawsuits === <b>Trump</b> is the subject of numerous probes into his actions and business dealings before, during and after his presidency. In February 2021, the district attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, Fani Willis, announced a criminal probe into Trump's phone calls to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The New York State Attorney General's Office is conducting criminal investigations into Trump's business activities in conjunction with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. By May 2021, a special grand jury was considering indictments. In July 2021, New York prosecutors charged the <b>Trump</b> Organization with a \"15 year 'scheme to defraud' the government\". In January 2023, the organization's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, was sentenced to five months in jail and five years probation for tax fraud after a plea deal. ==== FBI investigations ==== When <b>Trump</b> left the White House in January 2021, he took government documents and material with him to Mar-a-Lago. By May 2021, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the federal agency that preserves government records, realized that important documents had not been turned over to them at the end of Trump's term and asked his office to locate them. In January 2022, they retrieved 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA later informed the Department of Justice that some of the retrieved documents were classified material. The Justice Department began an investigation in April 2022 and convened a grand jury. The Justice Department sent <b>Trump</b> a subpoena for additional material on May 11. On June 3, Justice Department officials visited Mar-a-Lago and received some classified documents from Trump's lawyers. One of the lawyers signed a statement affirming that all material marked as classified had been returned to the government. Later that month an additional subpoena was sent requesting surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago, which was provided.On August 8, 2022, FBI agents searched Trump's residence, office, and storage areas at Mar-a-Lago to recover government documents and material <b>Trump</b> had taken with him when he left office in violation of the Presidential Records Act, reportedly including some related to nuclear weapons. The search warrant, authorized by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and approved by a federal magistrate judge, and the written inventory of the seized items were made public on August 12. The text of the search warrant indicates an investigation of potential violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice laws. The items taken in the search included 11 sets of classified documents, four of them tagged as \"top secret\" and one as \"top secret/SCI\", the highest level of classification.On November 18, 2022, Garland appointed a special counsel, federal prosecutor Jack Smith, to oversee the federal criminal investigations into <b>Trump</b> retaining government property at Mar-a-Lago and examining Trump's role in the events leading up to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. ==== Criminal referral by the House January 6 Committee ==== On December 19, 2022, the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack recommended criminal charges against <b>Trump</b> for obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and inciting or assisting an insurrection. ==== Federal and state criminal cases against <b>Trump</b> ==== ===== New York prosecution for falsifying business records ===== On March 30, 2023, a New York grand jury indicted <b>Trump</b> on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. On April 4, he surrendered and was arrested and arraigned; he pleaded not guilty on all counts and was released. The trial is scheduled to begin on March 25, 2024. ===== Government and classified documents case ===== On June 8, the Justice Department indicted <b>Trump</b> in Miami federal court for 31 counts of \"willfully retaining national defense information under the Espionage Act\", one count of making false statements, and, jointly with a personal aide, single counts of conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding government documents, corruptly concealing records, concealing a document in a federal investigation and scheming to conceal their efforts. <b>Trump</b> pleaded not guilty to all charges. In July a superseding indictment added three additional criminal charges, bringing the number of charges in the case to 40. The trial is scheduled to begin on May 20, 2024. ===== Election obstruction case ===== On August 1, a Washington, D.C., federal grand jury indicted <b>Trump</b> on four counts for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. He was charged with conspiring with unnamed co-conspirators to defraud the United States, obstruct the certification of the Electoral College vote, and deprive people of the civil right to have their votes counted, as well as obstructing an official proceeding. <b>Trump</b> pleaded not guilty to all charges. The case is slated to go to trial on March 4, 2024. ===== Georgia election interference case ===== On August 14, a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury indicted <b>Trump</b> and 18 allies for racketeering \u2013 among other felonies \u2013 after <b>Trump</b> campaign officials accessed voting machines with election officials. On August 24, <b>Trump</b> surrendered, was placed under arrest and processed at Fulton County Jail, and released on bail. He posted the mug shot on Twitter and on his campaign website with a fundraising pitch. On August 31, he pleaded not guilty. ==== Civil lawsuits against <b>Trump</b> ==== ===== Class action lawsuit for fraud ===== In 2018, four investors filed a federal class action lawsuit against Trump, the <b>Trump</b> Organization, and his three eldest children for not disclosing that they were paid by ACN, Inc., when they recommended the company as a sound investment on The Apprentice. In July 2019, a district judge permitted the lawsuit to proceed with state-level claims of fraud, false advertising, and unfair competition. The case is slated to go to trial on January 29, 2024. ===== New York State's civil fraud case ===== In September 2022, the New York State Attorney General filed a civil fraud case against Trump, his three oldest children, and the <b>Trump</b> Organization. In December 2021, the Attorney General's office had subpoenaed <b>Trump</b> to produce documents related to his business. In April 2022, a New York state judge held <b>Trump</b> in contempt of court for failing to comply with the subpoena and imposed a fine of $10,000 per day until he does. <b>Trump</b> was deposed in August and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times. The judge presiding over the civil suit ruled in September 2023 that Trump, his adult sons and the <b>Trump</b> Organization repeatedly committed fraud and ordered their New York business certificates canceled and their business entities sent into receivership for dissolution. ===== E. Jean Carroll's lawsuits ===== In May 2023, a New York jury in a federal lawsuit brought by journalist E. Jean Carroll found <b>Trump</b> liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered him to pay her $5 million. <b>Trump</b> asked the district court for a new trial or a reduction of the damage award, arguing that the jury had not found him liable for rape, and also, in a separate lawsuit, countersued Carroll for defamation. The judge for the two lawsuits ruled against <b>Trump</b> in July and August. <b>Trump</b> appealed both decisions to an appeals court. The trial in the defamation case is scheduled to begin on January 15, 2024. === 2024 presidential campaign === On November 15, 2022, <b>Trump</b> announced his candidacy for the 2024 United States presidential election and set up a fundraising account. In March 2023, the campaign began diverting 10 percent of the donations to Trump's leadership PAC which had paid $16 million for his legal bills by June 2023. == Public image == === Scholarly assessment and public approval surveys === C-SPAN, which has surveyed presidential historians on presidential leadership each time the administration changed since 2000, ranked <b>Trump</b> fourth\u2013lowest overall in their Presidential Historians Survey 2021, with <b>Trump</b> rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills. The Siena College Research Institute (SCRI) has surveyed presidential scholars during the second year of the first term of each president since 1982. In their 2022 survey, SCRI ranked <b>Trump</b> 43rd out of 45 presidents. He was ranked last on background, integrity, intelligence, foreign policy accomplishments, and executive appointments, and second to last on ability to compromise, executive ability, and present overall view. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership.Trump was the only president never to reach a 50 percent approval rating in the Gallup poll dating to 1938. His approval ratings showed a record-high partisan gap: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats. Until September 2020, the ratings were unusually stable, reaching a high of 49 percent and a low of 35 percent. <b>Trump</b> finished his term with an approval rating between 29 percent and 34 percent\u2014the lowest of any president since modern polling began\u2014and a record-low average of 41 percent throughout his presidency.In Gallup's annual poll asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, <b>Trump</b> placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for most admired man in 2019, and was named most admired in 2020. Since Gallup started conducting the poll in 1948, <b>Trump</b> is the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office.A Gallup poll in 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between the years 2016 and 2017 found that <b>Trump</b> led Obama in job approval in only 29 countries, most of them non-democracies; approval of U.S. leadership plummeted among allies and G7 countries. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the George W. Bush presidency. By mid-2020, only 16 percent of international respondents to a 13-nation Pew Research poll expressed confidence in Trump, a lower score than those accorded to Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping. === False or misleading statements === As a candidate and as president, <b>Trump</b> frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks to an extent unprecedented in American politics. His falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity.Trump's false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied a total of 30,573 false or misleading statements made by <b>Trump</b> over his four-year term. Trump's falsehoods increased in frequency over time, rising from about six false or misleading claims per day in his first year as president to 16 per day in his second year, 22 per day in his third year, and 39 per day in his final year.Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his claim of the \"biggest inaugural crowd ever\". Others had more far-reaching effects, such as his promotion of unproven antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19 in a press conference and on Twitter. The claims had consequences worldwide, such as a shortage of these drugs in the United States and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia. Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror\", served Trump's domestic political purposes. As a matter of principle, <b>Trump</b> does not apologize for his falsehoods.Despite the frequency of Trump's falsehoods, the media rarely referred to them as lies. The first time The Washington Post did so was in August 2018, when it declared that some of Trump's misstatements, in particular those concerning hush money paid to Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, were lies.In 2020, <b>Trump</b> was a significant source of disinformation on mail-in voting and misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic. His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices served to weaken public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.James Pfiffner, professor of policy and government at George Mason University, wrote in 2019 that <b>Trump</b> lies differently from previous presidents, because he offers \"egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to well-known facts\"; these lies are the \"most important\" of all <b>Trump</b> lies. By calling facts into question, people will be unable to properly evaluate their government, with beliefs or policy irrationally settled by \"political power\"; this erodes liberal democracy, wrote Pfiffner. === Promotion of conspiracy theories === Before and throughout his presidency, <b>Trump</b> has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama birtherism, the Clinton body count conspiracy theory, the conspiracy theory movement QAnon, the Global warming hoax theory, <b>Trump</b> Tower wiretapping allegations, a John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory involving Rafael Cruz, linking talk show host Joe Scarborough to the death of a staffer, alleged foul-play in the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections, and that Osama bin Laden was alive and Obama and Biden had members of Navy SEAL Team 6 killed. In at least two instances, <b>Trump</b> clarified to press that he also believed the conspiracy theory in question.During and since the 2020 presidential election, <b>Trump</b> has promoted various conspiracy theories for his defeat including dead people voting, voting machines changing or deleting <b>Trump</b> votes, fraudulent mail-in voting, throwing out <b>Trump</b> votes, and \"finding\" suitcases full of Biden votes. === Incitement of violence === Research suggests Trump's rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes. During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters. Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive a lighter sentence. A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which <b>Trump</b> was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against members of minority groups. === Social media === Trump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He tweeted frequently during the 2016 election campaign and as president until Twitter banned him in the final days of his term. <b>Trump</b> often used Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public and sidelining of the press. In June 2017, a White House press secretary said that Trump's tweets were official presidential statements. <b>Trump</b> often announced terminations of administration officials over Twitter.After years of criticism for allowing <b>Trump</b> to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checking warnings in May 2020. In response, <b>Trump</b> tweeted that \"Social Media Platforms totally silence conservative[] voices\" and that he would \"strongly regulate[] or close them down\". In the days after the storming of the United States Capitol, <b>Trump</b> was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms. The loss of Trump's social media presence diminished his ability to shape events and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter. Trump's early attempts to re-establish a social media presence were unsuccessful. In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following. Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, reinstated Trump's Twitter account in November 2022. === Relationship with the press === <b>Trump</b> sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love\u2013hate\" relationship with the press. In the 2016 campaign, <b>Trump</b> benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries. The New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV.\"As a candidate and as president, <b>Trump</b> frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\". In 2018, journalist Lesley Stahl recounted Trump's saying he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".As president, <b>Trump</b> privately and publicly mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical. His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts. In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump. The <b>Trump</b> White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.Trump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press. In early 2020, the <b>Trump</b> campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference. Legal experts said that the lawsuits lacked merit and were not likely to succeed. By March 2021, the lawsuits against The New York Times and CNN had been dismissed. === Racial views === Many of Trump's comments and actions have been considered racist. In national polling, about half of respondents said that <b>Trump</b> is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists. Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of <b>Trump</b> voters. Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters. He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. As of 2019, he maintained this position.In 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, he became the leading proponent of the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States. In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him \"very popular\". In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S. In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views in private.According to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, <b>Trump</b> made \"explicitly racist appeals to whites\" during his 2016 presidential campaign. In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists\". His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding <b>Trump</b> University were also criticized as racist. Trump's comments on the 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, condemning \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\" and stating that there were \"very fine people on both sides\", were widely criticized as implying a moral equivalence between the white supremacist demonstrators and the counter-protesters.In a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation, <b>Trump</b> reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\". His remarks were condemned as racist.In July 2019, <b>Trump</b> tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen\u2014all from minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans\u2014should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\". Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240\u2013187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\". White nationalist publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days. <b>Trump</b> continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign. === Misogyny and allegations of sexual misconduct === <b>Trump</b> has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to media and on social media. He made lewd comments, demeaned women's looks, and called them names, such as \"dog\", \"crazed\", \"crying lowlife\", \"face of a pig\", or \"horseface\".At least 26 women publicly accused <b>Trump</b> of rape, kissing, and groping without consent; looking under women's skirts; and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. <b>Trump</b> has denied all of the allegations.In October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which <b>Trump</b> was heard bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy.\" The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign and caused outrage across the political spectrum. === Popular culture === <b>Trump</b> has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature on television, in films, and in comics. He has been named in hundreds of hip hop songs since the 1980s\u2014until 2015, most of these references cast <b>Trump</b> in a positive light, but they turned largely negative after he began running for office. == Notes == == References == === Works cited === \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b == External links == Archive of Donald Trump's tweets Appearances on C-SPAN Donald <b>Trump</b> at IMDb Donald <b>Trump</b> on the Internet Archive Donald Trump's page on whitehouse.gov", "summary": "Donald John <b>Trump</b> (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. <b>Trump</b> received a Bachelor of Science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, and his father named him president of his real estate business in 1971. <b>Trump</b> renamed it the <b>Trump</b> Organization and reoriented the company toward building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business reversals in the late twentieth century, he successfully launched side ventures that required little capital, mostly by licensing the <b>Trump</b> name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six business bankruptcies. <b>Trump</b> won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He was the first U.S. president with no prior military or government experience. The 2017\u20132019 special counsel investigation established that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to favor Trump's campaign. <b>Trump</b> promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist and many as misogynistic. As president, <b>Trump</b> ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and implemented a policy of family separations for migrants detained at the U.S. border. He weakened environmental protections, rolling back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation about unproven treatments. <b>Trump</b> initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times but made no progress on denuclearization. <b>Trump</b> refused to concede defeat after losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud, and attempted to overturn the results by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of unsuccessful legal challenges, and obstructing the presidential transition. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, which many of them then attacked, resulting in multiple deaths and interrupting the electoral vote count. <b>Trump</b> is the only American president to have been impeached twice. After he tried to pressure Ukraine in 2019 to investigate Biden, he was impeached by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress; he was acquitted by the Senate in February 2020. The House impeached him again in January 2021, for incitement of insurrection, and the Senate acquitted him in February. Scholars and historians rank <b>Trump</b> as one of the worst presidents in American history.Since leaving office, <b>Trump</b> has remained heavily involved in the Republican Party. In November 2022, he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election. In 2023, <b>Trump</b> was indicted in New York on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, in Florida on 40 felony counts related to his handling of classified documents, in Washington, D.C., on four felony counts of conspiracy and obstruction for efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and in Georgia on 19 charges of racketeering and other alleged felonies committed in an effort to overturn the state's 2020 election results. <b>Trump</b> pleaded not guilty to all charges.", "Words": ["Trump"]}, {"title": "Family of Donald Trump", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "content": "The family of Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States (2017\u20132021) and owner of The <b>Trump</b> Organization, is a prominent American family of German and Scottish descent. They are active in business, entertainment, politics, and real estate. Donald Trump, his third wife Melania, and their son Barron were the first family for the duration of his presidency. Trump's father Fred was the son of German immigrants, while his mother Mary Anne MacLeod was a Scottish immigrant. <b>Trump</b> has five children from three wives and ten grandchildren. == Immediate family == === Wives === ==== Ivana <b>Trump</b> ==== Ivana Marie <b>Trump</b> (n\u00e9e Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1), the first wife of Donald Trump, was born on February 20, 1949, in Zl\u00edn, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). She was a fashion model and businesswoman who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988. They were married from 1977 until 1990. Ivana <b>Trump</b> died at her home in New York City at age 73 on July 14, 2022. Ivana was a senior executive of The <b>Trump</b> Organization for seven years, including executive vice president for interior design. She led the interior design of <b>Trump</b> Tower with its signature pink marble. Ivana was appointed CEO and president of the <b>Trump</b> Castle Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City and later became the manager of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. ==== Marla Maples ==== ==== Melania <b>Trump</b> ==== Melania <b>Trump</b> (n\u00e9e Knavs), the third wife of Donald Trump, was born on April 26, 1970, in Novo Mesto, Yugoslavia (present-day Slovenia). She had a lengthy modeling career and is the second foreign-born first lady of the United States, the first being Louisa Adams. They were married in 2005. Melania became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. She did not immediately move into the White House when her husband became president, but remained at <b>Trump</b> Tower with their son Barron until the end of the 2016\u20132017 school year. He and his mother moved to the White House on June 11, 2017. === Children === <b>Trump</b> has five children from three marriages: Don Jr., Ivanka, and Eric <b>Trump</b> with Ivana Trump; Tiffany <b>Trump</b> with Marla Maples; and Barron <b>Trump</b> with Melania Trump. ==== First marriage ==== Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric are Trump's three eldest children, from his first marriage with Ivana Trump.Prior to the election, each of the siblings held the title of executive vice president at the <b>Trump</b> Organization. During the campaign, they served as surrogates for their father on national news programs. Following Trump's election victory, all three were named to the presidential transition team.Following the inauguration, Donald Jr. and Eric took charge of the family's real estate empire. Ivanka moved to Washington, D.C., with her husband Jared Kushner, who was appointed to a senior White House advisory position. ==== Second marriage ==== Tiffany Ariana <b>Trump</b> (born October 13, 1993) is Donald Trump's only child with Marla Maples. In 2016, she participated little in her father's campaign because she was studying sociology and urban studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Shortly after graduating, she made a supportive speech for her father at the Republican National Convention at age 22. She was awarded a J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. in May 2020. ==== Third marriage ==== Barron William <b>Trump</b> (born March 20, 2006) is Trump's youngest child and his only child with Melania Trump. In May 2006, Barron <b>Trump</b> was baptized at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida. He attended the Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School in Manhattan. In addition to English, Barron is fluent in Slovene.In 2017 when his father took office as president, Barron and his mother remained in Manhattan to finish out the school year. In June he and Melania moved to the White House and he enrolled in St. Andrew's Episcopal School, a private co-ed school in Potomac, Maryland. In 2021 when his father left the White House and moved to Florida, he again finished out the school year, then went to Florida and enrolled in Oxbridge Academy, a private college-preparatory high school in West Palm Beach, Florida.Barron is known to be a fan of soccer. He appeared in an Arsenal F.C. jersey and met D.C. United players at the White House Easter Egg Roll in April 2017. In September 2017, he was selected to join the U-12 team for D.C. United's Development Academy for the 2017\u20132018 season. As of February 2019, Barron played with the Arlington Soccer Association. === Grandchildren === Donald <b>Trump</b> has ten grandchildren. Son Donald <b>Trump</b> Jr. and his former wife Vanessa had five children, daughter Ivanka <b>Trump</b> and her husband Jared Kushner, three, and son Eric <b>Trump</b> and his wife Lara, two. == Ancestry == According to biographer Gwenda Blair, the family descended from an itinerant lawyer, Hanns Drumpf, who settled in Kallstadt, a village in the Palatinate, Germany, in 1608, and whose descendants changed their name from Drumpf to <b>Trump</b> during the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648). The last name <b>Trump</b> is on record in Kallstadt since the 18th century. Journalist Kate Connolly, visiting Kallstadt, found several variations in spelling of the surname in the village archives, including Drumb, Tromb, Tromp, Trum, Trumpff, and Dromb. Even very diverse variations in spelling are common in German names before standardization as the wider population lacked literacy and names were transcribed from their spoken form rather than copied from documents.Johannes Trump, born in the nearby village Bobenheim am Berg in 1789, had established himself by the early 1830s as a winegrower in Kallstadt where his grandson, Friedrich Trump, the grandfather of Donald Trump, was born in 1869. Several of his descendants also were vintners in Kallstadt, one of many villages in the famous wine-growing region of the Palatinate (Pfalz). Johannes Trump's sister Charlotte Louisa married Johann Georg Heinz. Their son Johann Heinrich (John Henry) Heinz (1811\u20131891), who emigrated to the United States in 1840, was the father of Henry J. Heinz (1844\u20131919), founder of the Heinz company and Donald Trump's second cousin twice removed.This German heritage was long concealed by Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, who had grown up in a mainly German-speaking environment until he was ten years old; after World War II and until the 1980s, he told people he was of Swedish ancestry. Donald <b>Trump</b> repeated this version in The Art of the Deal (1987) but later said he is \"proud\" of his German heritage, and served as grand marshal of the 1999 German-American Steuben Parade in New York City.The <b>Trump</b> family in Germany were Lutheran. Donald Trump's parents attended First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, where <b>Trump</b> was confirmed in 1959. === Family tree === == Parents == === Fred <b>Trump</b> === Donald Trump's father, Fred <b>Trump</b> (1905\u20131999), born in New York, was a successful real estate developer in New York City. Using their inheritance, Fred <b>Trump</b> and his mother Elizabeth founded E. <b>Trump</b> & Son in 1927. The company grew to build and manage single-family houses in Queens, barracks and garden apartments for U.S. Navy personnel near major shipyards along the East Coast, and more than 27,000 apartments in New York City. <b>Trump</b> was investigated by a U.S. Senate committee for profiteering in 1954, and again by the State of New York in 1966.Donald <b>Trump</b> became the president of his father's real estate business in 1971, and renamed it the <b>Trump</b> Organization around 1973. That year, Donald and his father were sued by the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division for violating the Fair Housing Act. In the mid-1970s, Donald received loans from his father exceeding $14 million (later claimed by Donald to have been only $1 million). Donald served as the <b>Trump</b> Organization's chairman and president until assuming the office of U.S. president. === Mary Anne MacLeod <b>Trump</b> === Born as Mary Anne MacLeod (1912\u20132000) in Tong, a small village near Stornoway, in the Western Isles of Scotland, she was a daughter of fisherman Malcolm MacLeod and Mary MacLeod (n\u00e9e Smith). At age 17, she immigrated to the United States with $50 (equivalent to $852 in 2022), and moved in with a sister before starting work as a maid in New York. Mary and Fred <b>Trump</b> met in New York and married in 1936, settling together in Queens. Mary became a U.S. citizen in 1942. While visiting Scotland in June 2008, Donald <b>Trump</b> said in part, \"I think I do feel Scottish.\" == Grandparents == === Frederick <b>Trump</b> === In 1885, Donald Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Trump, emigrated from Kallstadt, Palatinate (then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria), to the United States at age 16. He anglicized his name to Frederick in 1892 when he became a U.S. citizen. During the Klondike Gold Rush, he amassed a fortune by opening a restaurant and hotel in Bennett and later Whitehorse, serving gold seekers on their way to the region; one biographer wrote that the business included a brothel, a portrayal Donald <b>Trump</b> has said was \"totally false\". On attempting to return, Frederick was exiled by Germany in 1905 for his lack of mandatory military service and not giving authorities notice before his 1885 departure; an appeal was denied. He died in the first wave of the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918. After his death, his fortune was passed on to his wife and son. === Elizabeth Christ <b>Trump</b> === Donald Trump's grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, was born in 1880 and died on June 6, 1966. She married Frederick <b>Trump</b> in 1902 and moved to the United States with him. Like her husband, she was a native of Kallstadt, born as the daughter of Philipp and Marie Christ. Philipp Christ was descended from Johannes Christ (1626\u20131688/9) of Fl\u00f6rsheim, Hesse. Elizabeth Christ <b>Trump</b> was a descendant of organ builder Johann Michael Hartung (1708\u20131763) through her paternal grandmother Sabina Christ. == Siblings == === Maryanne <b>Trump</b> Barry === Maryanne Barry (1937\u20132023) was Donald Trump's eldest sister. She was a senior federal judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, became inactive in 2017 after her brother took office, and retired in 2019. === Fred <b>Trump</b> Jr. === Frederick \"Freddy\" Crist [sic] <b>Trump</b> Jr. (1938\u20131981) was Donald Trump's older brother. On September 26, 1981, at the age of 42, he died from a heart attack. === Elizabeth <b>Trump</b> Grau === Elizabeth <b>Trump</b> Grau (born 1942) is an older sister of Donald Trump. In 1989, she married film producer James Grau. She worked as an administrative assistant for Chase Manhattan Bank, before retiring to Florida. She is the only living sibling of Donald Trump. === Robert <b>Trump</b> === Robert <b>Trump</b> (1948\u20132020) was Donald Trump's younger brother. He was a business executive who managed <b>Trump</b> Management Inc, the <b>Trump</b> Organization's real estate holdings outside Manhattan. He was an investor in SHiRT LLC, one of two owners of Virginia-based CertiPathx which was awarded a $33 million government contract in 2019.Robert <b>Trump</b> married Blaine Beard in 1980. They were divorced in 2009 after <b>Trump</b> had left his wife for <b>Trump</b> Organization employee Ann Marie Pallan. He married Pallan in early 2020. <b>Trump</b> died on August 15, 2020, at the age of 71. According to The New York Times, he had been having brain bleeds after a recent fall. == Other relatives == === John G. <b>Trump</b> === Donald Trump's paternal uncle John George <b>Trump</b> (1907\u20131985) was an electrical engineer, inventor and physicist who developed rotational radiation therapy, and, together with Robert J. Van de Graaff, one of the first million-volt X-ray generators. He was a recipient of Ronald Reagan's National Medal of Science and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. === John W. Walter === Trump's first cousin John W. Walter (1934\u20132018) was a son of father Fred's sister Elizabeth <b>Trump</b> and William Walter. He worked for the <b>Trump</b> Organization for most of his life and was executive vice president of <b>Trump</b> Management, Inc. He shared ownership of All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp with Donald Trump, Maryanne <b>Trump</b> Barry, Elizabeth <b>Trump</b> Grau, and Robert Trump. Walter also served as the mayor of Flower Hill, New York between 1988 and 1996, and as its historian from 1996 until his death in 2018. === Mary L. <b>Trump</b> === Donald Trump's niece Mary L. <b>Trump</b> is a clinical psychologist, businessperson, and author who wrote a book about Donald <b>Trump</b> and the family titled Too Much and Never Enough (2020). == Summary table == == References == === Citations === === Works cited ===", "summary": "The family of Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States (2017\u20132021) and owner of The <b>Trump</b> Organization, is a prominent American family of German and Scottish descent.

Trumpists and Trumpians are terms used to refer to those exhibiting characteristics of Trumpism. Trumpism has been referred to as an authoritarian movement.The precise composition of Trumpism is sufficiently complex to overwhelm any single framework of analysis; it has been referred to as an American political variant of the far right and the national-populist and neo-nationalist sentiment seen in multiple nations worldwide from the late 2010s to the early 2020s. Though not strictly limited to any one party, <b>Trump</b> supporters became the largest faction of the Republican Party in the United States, with the remainder often characterized as \"the elite\" or \"the establishment\" in contrast. In response to the rise of Trump, anti-Trump elites formed a Never <b>Trump</b> movement. Some commentators have rejected the populist designation for Trumpism and view it instead as part of a trend towards a new form of fascism or neo-fascism, with some referring to it as explicitly fascist and others as authoritarian and illiberal. Others have more mildly identified it as a specific lite version of fascism in the United States. Some historians, including many of those using a new fascism classification, write of the hazards of direct comparisons with European fascist regimes of the 1930s, stating that while there are parallels, there are also important dissimilarities. Certain characteristics within public relations and Trump's political base have exhibited symptoms of a cult of personality.The label Trumpism has been applied to national-conservative and national-populist movements in other democracies, and many politicians outside of the United States have been labeled as staunch allies of <b>Trump</b> or Trumpism, or even as their country's equivalent to Trump, by various news agencies; among them are Jair Bolsonaro, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Jacob Zuma, Shinzo Abe, and Yoon Suk Yeol. == Populist themes, sentiments, and methods == Trumpism started its development during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Trump's rhetoric has its roots in a populist political method that suggests nationalistic answers to political, economic, and social problems. These inclinations are refracted into such policy preferences as immigration restrictionism, trade protectionism, isolationism, and opposition to entitlement reform. As a political method, populism is not driven by any particular ideology. Former National Security Advisor and close <b>Trump</b> advisor John Bolton states this is true of Trump, disputing that Trumpism even exists in any meaningful philosophical sense, adding that \"[t]he man does not have a philosophy. And people can try and draw lines between the dots of his decisions. They will fail.\"Writing for the Routledge Handbook of Global Populism (2019), Olivier Jutel writes, \"What Donald <b>Trump</b> reveals is that the various iterations of right-wing American populism have less to do with a programmatic social conservatism or libertarian economics than with enjoyment.\" Referring to the populism of Trump, sociologist Michael Kimmel states that it \"is not a theory [or] an ideology, it's an emotion. And the emotion is righteous indignation that the government is screwing 'us'\". Kimmel notes that \"Trump is an interesting character because he channels all that sense of what I called 'aggrieved entitlement,'\" a term Kimmel defines as \"that sense that those benefits to which you believed yourself entitled have been snatched away from you by unseen forces larger and more powerful. You feel yourself to be the heir to a great promise, the American Dream, which has turned into an impossible fantasy for the very people who were supposed to inherit it.\"Communications scholar Zizi Papacharissi explains the utility of being ideologically vague, and using terms and slogans that can mean anything the supporter wants them to mean. \"When these publics thrive in affective engagement it's because they've found an affective hook that's built around an open signifier that they get to use and reuse and re-employ. So yes, of course you know, President <b>Trump</b> has used MAGA; that's an open signifier that pulls in all of these people, and is open because it allows them all to assign different meanings to it. So MAGA works for connecting publics that are different, because it is open enough to permit people to ascribe their own meaning to it.\"Other contributors to the Routledge Handbook of Populism note that populist leaders rather than being ideology driven are instead pragmatic and opportunistic regarding themes, ideas and beliefs that strongly resonate with their followers. Exit polling data suggests the campaign was successful at mobilizing the \"white disenfranchised\", the lower- to working-class European-Americans who are experiencing growing social inequality and who often have stated opposition to the American political establishment. Ideologically, Trumpism has a right-wing populist accent.Some prominent conservatives formed a Never <b>Trump</b> movement in response to his anti-establishment rhetoric, seen as a rebellion of the conservative elites against the base. === Focus on sentiments === Historian Peter E. Gordon observes that \"Trump, far from being a violation of the norm, actually signifies an emergent norm of the social order\" where the categories of the psychological and political have dissolved. In accounting for Trump's election and ability to sustain stable high approval ratings among a significant segment of voters, Erika Tucker points out in the book <b>Trump</b> and Political Philosophy that though all presidential campaigns have strong emotions associated with them, <b>Trump</b> was able to recognize, and then to gain the trust and loyalty of those who, like him, felt a particular set of strong emotions about perceived changes in the United States. She notes, \"Political psychologist Drew Westen has argued that Democrats are less successful at gauging and responding to affective politics\u2014issues that arouse strong emotional states in citizens.\"Like many academics examining the populist appeal of Trump's messaging, Hidalgo-Tenorio and Ben\u00edtez-Castro draw on the theories of Ernesto Laclau writing, \"The emotional appeal of populist discourse is key to its polarising effects, this being so much so that populism 'would be unintelligible without the affective component.' (Laclau 2005, 11)\" Scholars from a wide number of fields have observed that particular affective themes and the dynamics of their impact on social media-connected followers characterize <b>Trump</b> and his supporters. <b>Trump</b> uses rhetoric that political scientists have deemed to be both dehumanizing and connected to physical violence by Trump's followers. === Pleasure from sympathetic company === Communications scholar Michael Carpini states that \"Trumpism is a culmination of trends that have been occurring for several decades. What we are witnessing is nothing short of a fundamental shift in the relationships between journalism, politics, and democracy.\" Among the shifts, Carpini identifies \"the collapsing of the prior [media] regime's presumed and enforced distinctions between news and entertainment.\" Examining Trump's use of media for the book Language in the <b>Trump</b> Era, communication professor Marco Jacquemet writes that \"It's an approach that, like much of the rest of Trump's ideology and policy agenda, assumes (correctly, it appears) that his audiences care more about shock and entertainment value in their media consumption than almost anything else.\"The perspective is shared among other communication academics, with Plasser & Ulram (2003) describing a media logic which emphasizes \"personalization ... a political star system ... [and] sports based dramatization.\" Olivier Jutel notes that \"Donald Trump's celebrity status and reality-TV rhetoric of 'winning' and 'losing' corresponds perfectly to these values\", asserting that \"Fox News and conservative personalities from Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and Alex Jones do not simply represent a new political and media voice but embody the convergence of politics and media in which affect and enjoyment are the central values of media production.\"Studying Trump's use of social media, anthropologist Jessica Johnson finds that social emotional pleasure plays a central role, writing, \"Rather than finding accurate news meaningful, Facebook users find the affective pleasure of connectivity addictive, whether or not the information they share is factual, and that is how communicative capitalism captivates subjects as it holds them captive.\" Looking back at the world prior to social media, communications researcher Brian L. Ott writes: \"I'm nostalgic for the world of television that [Neil] Postman (1985) argued, produced the 'least well-informed people in the Western world' by packaging news as entertainment. (pp. 106\u2013107) Twitter is producing the most self-involved people in history by treating everything one does or thinks as newsworthy. Television may have assaulted journalism, but Twitter killed it.\" Commenting on Trump's support among Fox News viewers, Hofstra University Communication Dean Mark Lukasiewicz has a similar perspective, writing, \"Tristan Harris famously said that social networks are about 'affirmation, not information'\u2014and the same can be said about cable news, especially in prime time.\" Arlie Russell Hochschild's perspective on the relationship between <b>Trump</b> supporters and their preferred sources of information - whether social media friends or news and commentary stars, is that they are trusted due to the affective bond they have with them. As media scholar Daniel Kreiss summarizes Hochschild, \"Trump, along with Fox News, gave these strangers in their own land the hope that they would be restored to their rightful place at the center of the nation, and provided a very real emotional release from the fetters of political correctness that dictated they respect people of color, lesbians and gays, and those of other faiths ... that the network's personalities share the same 'deep story' of political and social life, and therefore they learn from them 'what to feel afraid, angry, and anxious about.'\" From Kreiss's 2018 account of conservative personalities and media, information became less important than providing a sense of familial bonding, where \"family provides a sense of identity, place, and belonging; emotional, social, and cultural support and security; and gives rise to political and social affiliations and beliefs.\" Hochschild gives the example of one woman who explains the familial bond of trust with the star personalities. \"Bill O'Reilly is like a steady, reliable dad. Sean Hannity is like a difficult uncle who rises to anger too quickly. Megyn Kelly is like a smart sister. Then there's Greta Van Susteren. And Juan Williams, who came over from NPR, which was too left for him, the adoptee. They're all different, just like in a family.\"Media scholar Olivier Jutel focuses on the neoliberal privatization and market segmentation of the public square, noting that, \"Affect is central to the brand strategy of Fox which imagined its journalism not in terms of servicing the rational citizen in the public sphere but in 'craft[ing] intensive relationships with their viewers' (Jones, 2012: 180) in order to sustain audience share across platforms.\" In this segmented market, <b>Trump</b> \"offers himself as an ego-ideal to an individuated public of enjoyment that coalesce around his media brand as part of their own performance of identity.\" Jutel cautions that it is not just conservative media companies that benefit from the transformation of news media to conform to values of spectacle and reality TV drama. \"Trump is a definitive product of mediatized politics providing the spectacle that drives ratings and affective media consumption, either as part of his populist movement or as the liberal resistance.\"Researchers give differing emphasis to which emotions are important to followers. Michael Richardson argues in the Journal of Media and Cultural Studies that \"affirmation, amplification and circulation of disgust is one of the primary affective drivers of Trump's political success.\" Richardson agrees with Ott about the \"entanglement of Trumpian affect and social media crowds\" who seek \"affective affirmation, confirmation and amplification. Social media postings of crowd experiences accumulate as 'archives of feelings' that are both dynamic in nature and affirmative of social values (Pybus 2015, 239).\"Using <b>Trump</b> as an example, social trust expert Karen Jones follows philosopher Annette Baier in explaining that the masters of the art of creating trust and distrust are populist politicians and criminals. On this view, it is not moral philosophers who are the experts at discerning different forms of trust, but members of this class of practitioners who \"show a masterful appreciation of the ways in which certain emotional states drive out trust and replace it with distrust.\" Jones sees <b>Trump</b> as an exemplar of this class who recognize that fear and contempt are powerful tools that can reorient networks of trust and distrust in social networks in order to alter how a potential supporter \"interprets the words, deeds, and motives of the other.\" She points out that the tactic is used globally writing, \"A core strategy of Donald Trump, both as candidate and president, has been to manufacture fear and contempt towards some undocumented migrants (among other groups). This strategy of manipulating fear and contempt has gone global, being replicated with minor local adjustment in Australia, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Italy and the United Kingdom.\" === Right-wing authoritarian populism === Other academics have made politically urgent warnings about Trumpian authoritarianism, such as Yale sociologist Philip S. Gorski who writes, the election of Donald <b>Trump</b> constitutes perhaps the greatest threat to American democracy since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. There is a real and growing danger that representative government will be slowly but effectively supplanted by a populist form of authoritarian rule in the years to come. Media intimidation, mass propaganda, voter suppression, court packing, and even armed paramilitaries\u2014many of the necessary and sufficient conditions for an authoritarian devolution are gradually falling into place. Some academics regard such authoritarian backlash as a feature of liberal democracies. Some have even argued that <b>Trump</b> is a totalitarian capitalist exploiting the \"fascist impulses of his ordinary supporters that hide in plain sight.\" Michelle Goldberg, an opinion columnist for The New York Times, compares \"the spirit of Trumpism\" to classical fascist themes. The \"mobilizing vision\" of fascism is of \"the national community rising phoenix-like after a period of encroaching decadence which all but destroyed it\", which \"sounds a lot like MAGA\" (Make America Great Again) according to Goldberg. Similarly, like the <b>Trump</b> movement, fascism sees a \"need for authority by natural chiefs (always male), culminating in a national chieftain who alone is capable of incarnating the group's historical destiny.\" They believe in \"the superiority of the leader's instincts over abstract and universal reason\".Conservative columnist George Will considers Trumpism similar to fascism, stating that Trumpism is \"a mood masquerading as a doctrine\". National unity is based \"on shared domestic dreads\"\u2014for fascists the \"Jews\", for <b>Trump</b> the media (\"enemies of the people\"), \"elites\" and \"globalists\". Solutions come not from tedious \"incrementalism and conciliation\", but from the leader (who claims \"only I can fix it\") unfettered by procedure. The political base is kept entertained with mass rallies, but inevitably the strongman develops a contempt for those he leads. Both are based on machismo, and in the case of Trumpism, \"appeals to those in thrall to country-music manliness: 'We're truck-driving, beer-drinking, big-chested Americans too freedom-loving to let any itsy-bitsy [COVID-19] virus make us wear masks.'\" Disputing the view that the surge of support for Trumpism and Brexit represents a new phenomenon, political scientist Karen Stenner and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt present the argument that the far-right populist wave that seemed to 'come out of nowhere' did not in fact come out of nowhere. It is not a sudden madness, or virus, or tide, or even just a copycat phenomenon\u2014the emboldening of bigots and despots by others' electoral successes. Rather, it is something that sits just beneath the surface of any human society\u2014including in the advanced liberal democracies at the heart of the Western world\u2014and can be activated by core elements of liberal democracy itself. Discussing the statistical basis for their conclusions regarding the triggering of such waves, Stenner and Haidt present the view that \"authoritarians, by their very nature, want to believe in authorities and institutions; they want to feel they are part of a cohesive community. Accordingly, they seem (if anything) to be modestly inclined toward giving authorities and institutions the benefit of the doubt, and lending them their support until the moment these seem incapable of maintaining 'normative order'\"; the authors write that this normative order is regularly threatened by liberal democracy itself because it tolerates a lack of consensus in group values and beliefs, tolerates disrespect of group authorities, nonconformity to group norms, or norms proving questionable, and in general promotes diversity and freedom from domination by authorities. Stenner and Haidt regard such authoritarian waves as a feature of liberal democracies noting that the findings of their 2016 study of <b>Trump</b> and Brexit supporters was not unexpected, as they wrote: Across two decades of empirical research, we cannot think of a significant exception to the finding that normative threat tends either to leave non-authoritarians utterly unmoved by the things that catalyze authoritarians or to propel them toward being (what one might conceive as) their 'best selves.' In previous investigations, this has seen non-authoritarians move toward positions of greater tolerance and respect for diversity under the very conditions that seem to propel authoritarians toward increasing intolerance. Author and authoritarianism critic Masha Gessen contrasted the \"democratic\" strategy of the Republican establishment making policy arguments appealing to the public, with the \"autocratic\" strategy of appealing to an \"audience of one\" in Donald Trump. Gessen noted the fear of Republicans that <b>Trump</b> would endorse a primary election opponent or otherwise use his political power to undermine any fellow party members that he felt had betrayed him. The 2020 Republican Party platform simply endorsed \"the President's America-first agenda\", prompting comparisons to contemporary leader-focused party platforms in Russia and China.General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump, has described <b>Trump</b> as a \"wannabe dictator\": We are unique among the world's militaries. We don't take an oath to a country, we don't take an oath to a tribe, we don't take an oath to a religion. We don't take an oath to a king, or a queen, or a tyrant or a dictator. And we don't take an oath to a wannabe dictator. We take an oath to the Constitution and we take an oath to the idea that is America \u2013 and we're willing to die to protect it. === Nostalgia and male bravado === Nostalgia is a staple of American politics but according to Philip Gorski, Trumpian nostalgia is novel because among other things \"it severs the traditional connection between greatness and virtue.\" In the traditional \"Puritan narrative, moral decline precedes material and political decline, and a return to the law must precede any return to greatness. ... Not so in Trump's version of nostalgia. In this narrative, decline is brought about by docility and femininity and the return to greatness requires little more than a reassertion of dominance and masculinity. In this way, 'virtue' is reduced to its root etymology of manly bravado.\" In studies of the men who would become <b>Trump</b> supporters Michael Kimmel describes the nostalgia of male entitlement felt by men who despaired \"over whether or not anything could enable them to find a place with some dignity in this new, multicultural, and more egalitarian world. ... These men were angry, but they all looked back nostalgically to a time when their sense of masculine entitlement went unchallenged. They wanted to reclaim their country, restore their rightful place in it, and retrieve their manhood in the process.\"The term that describes the behavior of Kimmel's angry white males is toxic masculinity and according to William Liu, editor of the journal Psychology of Men and Masculinity, it applies especially to Trump. Kimmel was surprised at the sexual turn the 2016 election took and thinks that <b>Trump</b> is for many men a fantasy figure, an uber-male completely free to indulge every desire. \"Many of these guys feel that the current order of things has emasculated them, by which I mean it has taken away their ability to support a family and have great life. Here's a guy who says: 'I can build anything I want. I can do anything I want. I can have the women I want.' They're going, 'This guy is awesome!'\"Social psychologists Theresa Vescio and Nathaniel Schermerhorn note that \"In his 2016 presidential campaign, <b>Trump</b> embodied HM [hegemonic masculinity] while waxing nostalgic for a racially homogenous past that maintained an unequal gender order. <b>Trump</b> performed HM by repeatedly referencing his status as a successful businessman (\"blue-collar businessman\") and alluding to how tough he would be as president. Further contributing to his enactment of HM, <b>Trump</b> was openly hostile toward gender-atypical women, sexualized gender typical women, and attacked the masculinity of male peers and opponents.\" In their studies involving 2,007 people, they found that endorsement of hegemonic masculinity better predicted support for <b>Trump</b> than other factors, such as support for antiestablishment, antielitist, nativist, racist, sexist, homophobic or xenophobic perspectives. Neville Hoad, an expert on gender issues in South Africa, sees this as a common theme with another strongman leader, Jacob Zuma, comparing his \"Zulu Big Man version of toxic masculinity versus a dog whistle white supremacist version; the putative real estate billionaire turned reality television star\". Both authoritarian leaders are figureheads living the \"masculinist fantasy of freedom\" supporters dream of, a dream bound to national mythologies of the good life. According to Hoad, one description of this symbolism comes from Jacques Lacan who describes the supremely masculine mythic leader of the primal horde whose power to satisfy every pleasure or whim has not been castrated. By activating such fantasies, toxic masculine behaviors from opulent displays of greed (the dream palaces of Mar-a-Lago and Nkandla), violent rhetoric, \"grab them by the pussy\" \"locker room\" \"jokes\" to misogynist insults, philandering, and even sexual predatory behavior including allegations of groping and raping become political assets not liabilities.Gender role scholar Colleen Clemens describes this toxic masculinity as \"a narrow and repressive description of manhood, designating manhood as defined by violence, sex, status and aggression. It's the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured, while supposedly 'feminine' traits\u2014which can range from emotional vulnerability to simply not being hypersexual\u2014are the means by which your status as \"man\" can be taken away.\" Writing in the Journal of Human Rights, Kimberly Theidon notes the COVID-19 pandemic's irony of Trumpian toxic masculinity: \"Being a tough guy means wearing the mask of masculinity: Being a tough guy means refusing to don a mask that might preserve one's life and the lives of others.\"Tough guy bravado appeared on the internet prior to attack on Congress on January 6, 2021, with one poster writing, \"Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in ... . Get violent. Stop calling this a march, or rally, or a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our President or we die.\" Of the rioters arrested for the attack on the U.S. Capitol, 88% were men, and 67% were 35 years or older. === Christian Trumpism === According to 2016 election exit polls, 26% of voters self identified as white evangelical Christians, of whom more than three-fourths in 2017 approved of Trump's performance, most of them approving \"very strongly\" as reported by a Pew Research Center study. In contrast, approximately two-thirds of non-white evangelicals supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, with 90% of black Protestants also voting for her even though their theological views are similar to evangelicals. According to Yale researcher Philip Gorski, \"the question is not so much why evangelicals voted for <b>Trump</b> then\u2014many did not\u2014but why so many white evangelicals did.\" Gorski's answer to why Trump, and not an orthodox evangelical, was the first choice among white evangelicals was simply \"because they are also white Christian nationalists and Trumpism is inter alia a reactionary version of white Christian nationalism.\"Israeli philosopher Adi Ophir sees the politics of purity in the white Christian nationalist rhetoric of evangelical supporters, such as the comparison of Nehemiah's wall around Jerusalem to Trump's wall keeping out the enemy, writing, \"the notion of the enemy includes 'Mexican migrants', 'filthy' gays, and even Catholics 'led astray by Satan', and the real danger these enemies pose is degradation to a 'blessed\u2014great\u2014 ... nation' whose God is the Lord.\" Theologian Michael Horton believes Christian Trumpism represents the confluence of three trends that have come together, namely Christian American exceptionalism, end-times conspiracies, and the prosperity gospel, with Christian Americanism being the narrative that God specially called the United States into being as an extraordinary if not miraculous providence and end-times conspiracy referring to the world's annihilation (figurative or literal) due to some conspiracy of nefarious groups and globalist powers threatening American sovereignty. Horton thinks that what he calls the \"cult of Christian Trumpism\" blends these three ingredients with \"a generous dose of hucksterism\" as well as self-promotion and personality cult.Evangelical Christian and historian John Fea believes \"the church has warned against the pursuit of political power for a long, long time\", but that many modern-day evangelicals such as <b>Trump</b> advisor and televangelist Paula White ignore these admonitions. Televangelist Jim Bakker praises prosperity gospel preacher White's ability to \"walk into the White House at any time she wants to\" and have \"full access to the King.\" According to Fea, there are several other \"court evangelicals\" who have \"devoted their careers to endorsing political candidates and Supreme Court justices who will restore what they believe to be the Judeo-Christian roots of the country\" and who in turn are called on by <b>Trump</b> to \"explain to their followers why <b>Trump</b> can be trusted in spite of his moral failings\", including James Dobson, Franklin Graham, Johnnie Moore Jr., Ralph Reed, Gary Bauer, Richard Land, megachurch pastor Mark Burns and Southern Baptist pastor and Fox political commentator Robert Jeffress.For prominent Christians who fail to support Trump, the cost is not a simple loss of presidential access but a substantial risk of a firestorm of criticism and backlash, a lesson learned by Timothy Dalrymple, president of the flagship magazine of evangelicals Christianity Today, and former chief editor Mark Galli, who were condemned by more than two hundred evangelical leaders for co-authoring a letter arguing that Christians were obligated to support the impeachment of Trump.Historian Stephen Jaeger traces the history of admonitions against becoming beholden religious courtiers back to the 11th century, with warnings of curses placed on holy men barred from heaven for taking too \"keen an interest in the affairs of the state.\" Dangers to the court clergy were described by Peter of Blois, a 12th-century French cleric, theologian and courtier who \"knew that court life is the death of the soul\" and that despite participation at court being known to them to be \"contrary to God and salvation,\" the clerical courtiers whitewashed it with a multitude of justifications such as biblical references of Moses being sent by God to the Pharaoh. Pope Pius II opposed the clergy's presence at court, believing it was very difficult for a Christian courtier to \"rein in ambition, suppress avarice, tame envy, strife, wrath, and cut off vice, while standing in the midst of these [very] things.\" The ancient history of such warnings of the dark corrupting influence of power over holy leaders is recounted by Fea who directly compares it to behavior of Trump's court evangelical leaders, warning that Christians are \"in jeopardy of making idols out of political leaders by placing our sacred hopes in them.\" Jeffress claims that evangelical leaders' support of <b>Trump</b> is moral regardless of behavior that Christianity Today's chief editor called \"a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused.\" Jeffress argues that \"the godly principle here is that governments have one responsibility, and that is Romans 13 [which] says to avenge evil doers.\" This same biblical chapter was used by Jeff Sessions to claim biblical justification for Trump's policy of separating children from immigrant families. Historian Lincoln Muller explains this is one of two types of interpretations of Romans 13 which has been used in American political debates since its founding and is on the side of \"the thread of American history that justifies oppression and domination in the name of law and order.\"From Jeffress's reading, government's purpose is as a \"strongman to protect its citizens against evildoers\", adding: \"I don't care about that candidate's tone or vocabulary, I want the meanest toughest son a you-know-what I can find, and I believe that is biblical.\" Jeffress, who referred to Barack Obama as \"paving the way for the future reign of the Antichrist,\" Mitt Romney as a cult follower of a non-Christian religion and Roman Catholicism as a \"Satanic\" result of \"Babylonian mystery religion\" traces the Christian libertarian perspective on government's sole role to suppress evil back to Saint Augustine who argued in The City of God against the Pagans (426 CE) that government's role is to restrain evil so Christians can peacefully practice their beliefs. Martin Luther similarly believed that government should be limited to checking sin.Like Jeffress, Richard Land refused to cut ties with <b>Trump</b> after his reaction to the Charlottesville white supremacist rally, with the explanation that \"Jesus did not turn away from those who may have seemed brash with their words or behavior,\" adding that \"now is not the time to quit or retreat, but just the opposite\u2014to lean in closer.\" Johnnie Moore's explanation for refusing to repudiate <b>Trump</b> after his Charlottesville response was that \"you only make a difference if you have a seat at the table.\" Trinity Forum fellow Peter Wehner warns that \"[t]he perennial danger facing Christians is seduction and self-delusion. That's what's happening in the <b>Trump</b> era. The president is using evangelical leaders to shield himself from criticism.\"Evangelical biblical scholar Ben Witherington believes Trump's evangelical apologists' defensive use of the tax collector comparison is false and that retaining a \"seat at the table\" is supportable only if the Christian leader is admonishing the President to reverse course, explaining that \"[t]he sinners and tax collectors were not political officials, so there is no analogy there. Besides, Jesus was not giving the sinners and tax collectors political advice\u2014he was telling them to repent! If that's what evangelical leaders are doing with our President, and telling him when his politics are un-Christian, and explaining to him that racism is an enormous sin and there is no moral equivalency between the two sides in Charlottesville, then well and good. Otherwise, they are complicit with the sins of our leaders.\"Evangelical Bible studies author Beth Moore joins in criticism of the perspective of Trump's evangelicals, writing: \"I have never seen anything in these United States of America I found more astonishingly seductive and dangerous to the saints of God than Trumpism. This Christian nationalism is not of God. Move back from it.\" Moore warns that \"we will be held responsible for remaining passive in this day of seduction to save our own skin while the saints we've been entrusted to serve are being seduced, manipulated, USED and stirred up into a lather of zeal devoid of the Holy Spirit for political gain.\" Moore's view is that \"[w]e can't sanctify idolatry by labeling a leader our Cyrus. We need no Cyrus. We have a king. His name is Jesus.\"Other prominent white evangelicals have taken Bible based stands against Trump, such as Peter Wehner of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center and Russell D. Moore, a onetime president of the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. Wehner describes Trump's theology as embodying \"a Nietzschean morality rather than a Christian one,\" that evangelicals' \"support for <b>Trump</b> comes at a high cost for Christian witness,\" and that \"Trump's most enduring legacy [may be] a nihilistic political culture, one that is tribalistic, distrustful, and sometimes delusional, swimming in conspiracy theories.\" Moore sharply distanced himself from Trump's racial rhetoric, stating that the Bible \"speaks so directly to these issues\" and that \"in order to avoid questions of racial unity, one has to evade the Bible itself\".Presbyterian minister and Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author Chris Hedges has asserted that many of Trump's white evangelical supporters resemble those of the German Christians movement of 1930s Germany who also regarded their leader in an idolatrous way, the Christo-fascist idea of a Volk messiah, a leader who would act as an instrument of God to restore their country from moral depravity to greatness. Also rejecting the idolatry, John Fea said \"Trump takes everything that Jesus taught, especially in the Sermon on the Mount, throws it out the window, exchanges it for a mess of pottage called 'Make America Great Again', and from a Christian perspective for me, that borders on\u2014no, it is a form of idolatry.\" Theologian Greg Boyd has challenged the religious right's politicization of Christianity and the Christian nationalist theory of American exceptionalism, charging that \"a significant segment of American evangelicalism is guilty of nationalistic and political idolatry\". Boyd compares the cause of \"taking America back for God\" and policies to force Christian values through political coercion to the aspiration in first century Israel to \"take Israel back for God\", which caused followers to attempt to fit Jesus into the role of a political messiah. Boyd argues that Jesus declined to become a political leader, demonstrating that \"God's mode of operation in the world was no longer going to be nationalistic.\"Boyd asks whether Jesus ever suggested that Christians should aspire to gaining power in the reigning government of the day, or whether he advocated using civil laws to change the behavior of sinners. Like Fea, Boyd states he is not arguing for passive political noninvolvement (writing that \"of course our political views will be influenced by our Christian faith\"); rather, he asserts that Christians must embrace humility and not \"christen our views as 'the' Christian view\". This humility, in Boyd's view requires Christians to reject social domination. He contends that \"the only way we individually and collectively represent the kingdom of God is through loving, Christ like, sacrificial acts of service to others. Anything and everything else, however good and noble, lies outside the kingdom of God\".Horton asserts that rather than engaging in what he calls the cult of \"Christian Trumpism\", Christians should reject turning the \"saving gospel into a worldly power\". Fea contends that the Christian response to <b>Trump</b> should feature the principles and tactics used in the civil rights movement, namely preaching hope rather than fear; practicing humility, not using power to socially dominate others; and reading history responsibly (as in Martin Luther King Jr.'s Letter from Birmingham Jail) rather than feeling nostalgia for a prior American Christian utopia that never was. Conservative orthodox Christian writer Rod Dreher and theologian Michael Horton have argued that participants in the Jericho March were engaging in \"Trump worship\", akin to idolatry. In the National Review, Cameron Hilditch described the movement as: [a] toxic ideological cocktail of grievance, paranoia, and self-exculpatory rage ... Their aim was to \"stop the steal\" of the presidential election, [and] to prepare patriots for battle against a \"One-World Government\" ... In fact, there was a strange impression given throughout the event that attendees believe Christianity is, in some sense, consubstantial with American nationalism. It was as if a new and improved Holy Trinity of \"Father, Son, and Uncle Sam\" had taken the place of the old and outmoded Nicene version. When Eric Metaxas, the partisan radio host and emcee for the event, first stepped on stage, he wasn't greeted with psalm-singing or with hymns of praise to the Holy Redeemer, but with chants of \"USA! USA!\" In short, the Jericho rally was a worrying example of how Christianity can be twisted and drafted into the service of a political ideology. Emma Green in The Atlantic blamed pro-Trump, evangelical white Christians and the Jericho March participants for the storming of the Capitol building on January 6, 2021, saying: \"The mob carried signs and flag declaring Jesus Saves! and God, Guns & Guts Made America, Let's Keep All Three.\" === Methods of persuasion === Sociologist Arlie Hochschild thinks emotional themes in Trump's rhetoric are fundamental, writing that his \"speeches\u2014evoking dominance, bravado, clarity, national pride, and personal uplift\u2014inspire an emotional transformation,\" deeply resonating with their \"emotional self-interest\". Hochschild's perspective is that <b>Trump</b> is best understood as an \"emotions candidate\", arguing that comprehending the emotional self-interests of voters explains the paradox of the success of such politicians raised by Thomas Frank's book What's the Matter with Kansas?, an anomaly which motivated her five-year immersive research into the emotional dynamics of the Tea Party movement which she believes has mutated into Trumpism.The book resulting from her research, Strangers in Their Own Land, was named one of the \"6 books to understand Trump's Win\" by the New York Times. Hochschild claims it is wrong for progressives to assume that well educated individuals have mainly been persuaded by political rhetoric to vote against their rational self interest through appeals to the \"bad angels\" of their nature: \"their greed, selfishness, racial intolerance, homophobia, and desire to get out of paying taxes that go to the unfortunate.\" She grants that the appeal to bad angels are made by Trump, but that it \"obscures another\u2014to the right wing's good angels\u2014their patience in waiting in line in scary economic times, their capacity for loyalty, sacrifice, and endurance\", qualities she describes as a part of a motivating narrative she calls their \"deep story\", a social contract narrative that appears to be widely shared in other countries as well. She thinks Trump's approach towards his audience creates group cohesiveness among his followers by exploiting a crowd phenomenon Emile Durkheim called \"collective effervescence\", \"a state of emotional excitation felt by those who join with others they take to be fellow members of a moral or biological tribe ... to affirm their unity and, united, they feel secure and respected.\" Rhetorically, Trumpism employs absolutist framings and threat narratives characterized by a rejection of the political establishment. The absolutist rhetoric emphasizes non-negotiable boundaries and moral outrage at their supposed violation. The rhetorical pattern within a <b>Trump</b> rally is common for authoritarian movements. First, elicit a sense of depression, humiliation and victimhood. Second, separate the world into two opposing groups: a relentlessly demonized set of others versus those who have the power and will to overcome them. This involves vividly identifying the enemy supposedly causing the current state of affairs and then promoting paranoid conspiracy theories and fearmongering to inflame fear and anger. After cycling these first two patterns through the populace, the final message aims to produce a cathartic release of pent-up ochlocracy and mob energy, with a promise that salvation is at hand because there is a powerful leader who will deliver the nation back to its former glory. This three-part pattern was first identified in 1932 by Roger Money-Kyrle and later published in his Psychology of Propaganda. A constant barrage of sensationalistic rhetoric serves to rivet media attention while achieving multiple political objectives, not the least of which is that it serves to obscure actions such as profound neoliberal deregulation. One study gives the example that significant environmental deregulation occurred during the first year of the <b>Trump</b> administration due to its concurrent use of spectacular racist rhetoric but escaped much media attention. According to the authors, this served political objectives of dehumanizing its targets, eroding democratic norms, and consolidating power by emotionally connecting with and inflaming resentments among the base of followers but most importantly served to distract media attention from deregulatory policymaking by igniting intense media coverage of the distractions, precisely due to their radically transgressive nature.Trump's skill with personal branding allowed him to effectively market himself as the Money-Kyrle extraordinary leader by leveraging his celebrity status and name recognition. As one of the communications director for the MAGA super PAC put it in 2016, \"Like Hercules, Donald <b>Trump</b> is a work of fiction.\" Journalism professor Mark Danner explains that \"week after week for a dozen years millions of Americans saw Donald J. <b>Trump</b> portraying the business magus [in The Apprentice], the grand vizier of capitalism, the wise man of the boardroom, a living confection whose every step and word bespoke gravitas and experience and power and authority and ... money. Endless amounts of money.\"Political science scholar Andrea Schneiker regards the heavily promoted <b>Trump</b> public persona as that of a superhero, a genius but still \"an ordinary citizen that, in case of an emergency, uses his superpowers to save others, that is, his country. He sees a problem, knows what has to be done in order to solve it, has the ability to fix the situation and does so. According to the branding strategy of Donald <b>Trump</b> ... a superhero is needed to solve the problems of ordinary Americans and the nation as such, because politicians are not able to do so. Hence, the superhero per definition is an anti-politician. Due to his celebrity status and his identity as entertainer, Donald <b>Trump</b> can thereby be considered to be allowed to take extraordinary measures and even to break rules.\" According to civil rights lawyer Burt Neuborne and political theorist William E. Connolly, Trumpist rhetoric employs tropes similar to those used by fascists in Germany to persuade citizens (at first a minority) to give up democracy, by using a barrage of falsehoods, half-truths, personal invective, threats, xenophobia, national-security scares, religious bigotry, white racism, exploitation of economic insecurity, and a never-ending search for scapegoats. Neuborne found twenty parallel practices, such as creating what amounts to an \"alternate reality\" in adherents' minds, through direct communications, by nurturing a fawning mass media and by deriding scientists to erode the notion of objective truth; organizing carefully orchestrated mass rallies; bitterly attacking judges when legal cases are lost or rejected; using an uninterrupted stream of lies, half-truths, insults, vituperation and innuendo designed to marginalize, demonize and eventually destroy opponents; making jingoistic appeals to ultranationalist fervor; and promising to slow, stop and even reverse the flow of \"undesirable\" ethnic groups who are cast as scapegoats for the nation's ills.Connolly presents a similar list in his book Aspirational Fascism (2017), adding comparisons of the integration of theatrics and crowd participation with rhetoric, involving grandiose bodily gestures, grimaces, hysterical charges, dramatic repetitions of alternate reality falsehoods, and totalistic assertions incorporated into signature phrases that audiences are strongly encouraged to join in chanting. Despite the similarities, Connolly stresses that <b>Trump</b> is no Nazi but \"is rather, an aspirational fascist who pursues crowd adulation, hyperaggressive nationalism, white triumphalism, and militarism, pursues a law-and-order regime giving unaccountable power to the police, and is a practitioner of a rhetorical style that regularly creates fake news and smears opponents to mobilize support for the Big Lies he advances.\" Reporting on the crowd dynamics of Trumpist rallies has documented expressions of the Money-Kyrle pattern and associated stagecraft, with some comparing the symbiotic dynamics of crowd pleasing to that of the sports entertainment style of events which <b>Trump</b> was involved with since the 1980s. Critical theory scholar Douglas Kellner compares the elaborate staging of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will with that used with <b>Trump</b> supporters using the example of the preparation of photo op sequences and aggressive hyping of huge attendance expected for Trump's 2015 primary event in Mobile, Alabama, when the media coverage repeatedly cuts between the <b>Trump</b> jet circling the stadium, the rising excitement of rapturous admirers below, the motorcade and the final triumphal entrance of the individual Kellner claims is being presented as the \"political savior to help them out with their problems and address their grievances\".Connolly thinks the performance draws energy from the crowd's anger as it channels it, drawing it into a collage of anxieties, frustrations and resentments about malaise themes, such as deindustrialization, offshoring, racial tensions, political correctness, a more humble position for the United States in global security, economics and so on. Connolly observes that animated gestures, pantomiming, facial expressions, strutting and finger pointing are incorporated as part of the theater, transforming the anxiety into anger directed at particular targets, concluding that \"each element in a <b>Trump</b> performance flows and folds into the others until an aggressive resonance machine is formed that is more intense than its parts.\"Some academics point out that the narrative common in the popular press describing the psychology of such crowds is a repetition of a 19th-century theory by Gustave Le Bon when organized crowds were seen by political elites as potentially anarchic threats to the social order. In his book The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind (1895), Le Bon described a sort of collective contagion uniting a crowd into a near religious frenzy, reducing members to barbaric, if not subhuman levels of consciousness with mindless anarchic goals. Since such a description depersonalizes supporters, this type of Le Bon analysis is criticized because the would-be defenders of liberal democracy simultaneously are dodging responsibility for investigating grievances while also unwittingly accepting the same us vs. them framing of illiberalism. Connolly acknowledges the risks but considers it more risky to ignore that Trumpian persuasion is successful due to deliberate use of techniques evoking more mild forms of affective contagion. ==== Falsehoods ==== The absolutist rhetoric employed heavily favors crowd reaction over veracity, with a large number of falsehoods which <b>Trump</b> presents as facts. Drawing on Harry G. Frankfurt's book On Bullshit, political science professor Matthew McManus points out that it is more precise to identify <b>Trump</b> as a bullshitter whose sole interest is to persuade, and not a liar (e.g. Richard Nixon) who takes the power of truth seriously and so deceitfully attempts to conceal it. <b>Trump</b> by contrast is indifferent to the truth or unaware of it. Unlike conventional lies of politicians exaggerating their accomplishments, Trump's lies are egregious, making lies about easily verifiable facts. At one rally <b>Trump</b> stated his father \"came from Germany\", even though Fred <b>Trump</b> was born in New York City.Trump is surprised when his falsehoods are contradicted, as was the case when leaders at the 2018 United Nations General Assembly burst into laughter at his boast that he had accomplished more in his first two years than any other United States president. Visibly startled, <b>Trump</b> responded to the audience: \"I didn't expect that reaction.\" <b>Trump</b> lies about the trivial, such as claiming that there was no rain on the day of his inauguration when in fact it did rain, as well as making grandiose \"Big Lies\", such as claiming that Obama founded ISIS, or promoting the birther movement, a conspiracy theory which claims that Obama was born in Kenya, not Hawaii. Connolly points to the similarities of such reality-bending gaslighting with fascist and post Soviet techniques of propaganda including Kompromat (scandalous material), stating that \"Trumpian persuasion draws significantly upon the repetition of Big Lies.\" === More combative, less ideological base === Journalist Elaina Plott suggests ideology is not as important as other characteristics of Trumpism. Plott cites political analyst Jeff Roe, who observed <b>Trump</b> \"understood\" and acted on the trend among Republican voters to be \"less ideological\" but \"more polarized\". Republicans are now more willing to accept policies like government mandated health care coverage for pre-existing conditions or trade tariffs, formerly disdained by conservatives as burdensome government regulations. At the same time, strong avowals of support for <b>Trump</b> and aggressive partisanship have become part of Republican election campaigning\u2014in at least some parts of America\u2014reaching down even to non-partisan campaigns for local government which formerly were collegial and issue-driven. Research by political scientist Marc Hetherington and others has found <b>Trump</b> supporters tend to share a \"worldview\" transcending political ideology, agreeing with statements like \"the best strategy is to play hardball, even if it means being unfair.\" In contrast, those who agree with statements like \"cooperation is the key to success\" tend to prefer Trump's adversary former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.On January 31, 2021, a detailed overview of the attempt by combative <b>Trump</b> supporters to subvert the election of the United States was published in The New York Times. Journalist Nicholas Lemann writes of the disconnect between some of Trump's campaign rhetoric and promises, and what he accomplished once in office\u2014and the fact that the difference seemed to bother very few supporters. The campaign themes being anti-free-trade nationalism, defense of Social Security, attacks on big business, \"building that big, beautiful wall and making Mexico pay for it\", repealing Obama's Affordable Care Act, a trillion dollar infrastructure-building program. The accomplishments being \"conventional\" Republican policies and legislation\u2014substantial tax cuts, rollbacks of federal regulations, and increases in military spending. Many have noted that instead of the Republican National Convention issuing the customary \"platform\" of policies and promises for the 2020 campaign, it offered a \"one-page resolution\" stating that the party was not \"going to have a new platform, but instead ... 'has and will continue to enthusiastically support the president's America-first agenda.'\"An alternate nonideological circular definition of Trumpism widely held among <b>Trump</b> activists was reported by Saagar Enjeti, chief Washington correspondent for The Hill, who stated: \"I was frequently told by people wholly within the MAGA camp that trumpism meant anything <b>Trump</b> does, ergo nothing that he did is a departure from trumpism.\" === Ideological themes === Trumpism differs from classical Abraham Lincoln Republicanism in many ways regarding free trade, immigration, equality, checks and balances in federal government, and the separation of church and state. Peter J. Katzenstein of the WZB Berlin Social Science Center believes that Trumpism rests on three pillars, namely nationalism, religion and race. According to Jeff Goodwin, Trumpism is characterized by five key elements: social conservatism, neoliberal capitalism, economic nationalism, nativism, and white nationalism.At the 2021 CPAC conference, <b>Trump</b> gave his own definition of what defines Trumpism: \"What it means is great deals, ... . Like the USMCA replacement of the horrible NAFTA. ... It means low taxes and eliminated job killing regulations, ... . It means strong borders, but people coming into our country based on a system of merit. ... [I]t means no riots in the streets. It means law enforcement. It means very strong protection for the second amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. ... [I]t means a strong military and taking care of our vets ... .\" == Social psychology == === Dominance orientation === Social psychology research into the <b>Trump</b> movement, such as that of Bob Altemeyer, Thomas F. Pettigrew, and Karen Stenner, views the <b>Trump</b> movement as primarily being driven by the psychological predispositions of its followers. Altemeyer and other researchers such as Pettigrew emphasize that no claim is made that these factors provide a complete explanation, mentioning other research showing that important political and historical factors (reviewed elsewhere in this article) are also involved. The academic peer-reviewed journal Social Psychological and Personality Science published the article \"Group-Based Dominance and Authoritarian Aggression Predict Support for Donald <b>Trump</b> in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election\", describing a study concluding that <b>Trump</b> followers have a distinguishing preference for strongly hierarchical and ethnocentric social orders that favor their in-group.In a non-academic book which he co-authored with John Dean entitled Authoritarian Nightmare: <b>Trump</b> and His Followers, Altemeyer describes research which reaches the same conclusions. Despite disparate and inconsistent beliefs and ideologies, a coalition of such followers can become cohesive and broad in part because each individual \"compartmentalizes\" their thoughts and they are free to define their sense of the threatened tribal in-group in their own terms, whether it is predominantly related to their cultural or religious views (e.g. the mystery of evangelical support for Trump), nationalism (e.g. the Make America Great Again slogan), or their race (maintaining a white majority). Altemeyer, MacWilliams, Feldman, Choma, Hancock, Van Assche and Pettigrew claim that instead of directly attempting to measure such ideological, racial or policy views, supporters of such movements can be reliably predicted by using two social psychology scales (singly or in combination), namely right-wing authoritarian (RWA) measures which were developed in the 1980s by Altemeyer and other authoritarian personality researchers, and the social dominance orientation (SDO) scale developed in the 1990s by social dominance theorists. In May 2019, Monmouth University Polling Institute conducted a study in collaboration with Altemeyer in order to empirically test the hypothesis using the SDO and RWA measures. The finding was that social dominance orientation and affinity for authoritarian leadership are highly correlated with followers of Trumpism. Altemeyer's perspective and his use of an authoritarian scale and SDO to identify <b>Trump</b> followers is not uncommon. His study was a further confirmation of the earlier mentioned studies discussed in MacWilliams (2016), Feldman (2020), Choma and Hancock (2017), and Van Assche & Pettigrew (2016).The research does not imply that the followers always behave in an authoritarian manner but that expression is contingent, which means there is reduced influence if it is not triggered by fear and what the subject perceives as threats. The research is global and similar social psychological techniques for analyzing Trumpism have demonstrated their effectiveness at identifying adherents of similar movements in Europe, including those Belgium and France (Lubbers & Scheepers, 2002; Swyngedouw & Giles, 2007; Van Hiel & Mervielde, 2002; Van Hiel, 2012), the Netherlands (Cornelis & Van Hiel, 2014) and Italy (Leone, Desimoni & Chirumbolo, 2014). Quoting comments from participants in a series of focus groups made up of people who had voted for Democrat Obama in 2012 but flipped to <b>Trump</b> in 2016, pollster Diane Feldman noted the anti-government, anti-coastal-elite anger: \"'They think they're better than us, they're P.C., they're virtue-signallers.' '[Trump] doesn't come across as one of those people who think they're better than us and are screwing us.' 'They lecture us.' 'They don't even go to church.' 'They're in charge, and they're ripping us off.'\" === Basis in animal behavior === Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich explained the central role of dominance in his speech \"Principles of Trumpism\", comparing the needed leadership style to that of a violent bear. Psychology researcher Dan P. McAdams thinks a better comparison is to the dominance behavior of alpha male chimpanzees such as Yeroen, the subject of an extensive study of chimp social behavior conducted by renowned primatologist Frans de Waal. Christopher Boehm, a professor of biology and anthropology agrees, writing, \"his model of political posturing has echoes of what I saw in the wild in six years in Tanzania studying the Gombe chimpanzees,\" and \"seems like a classic alpha display.\"Using the example of Yeroen, McAdams describes the similarities: \"On Twitter, Trump's incendiary tweets are like Yeroen's charging displays. In chimp colonies, the alpha male occasionally goes berserk and starts screaming, hooting, and gesticulating wildly as he charges toward other males nearby. Pandemonium ensues as rival males cower in fear ... Once the chaos ends, there is a period of peace and order, wherein rival males pay homage to the alpha, visiting him, grooming him, and expressing various forms of submission. In Trump's case, his tweets are designed to intimidate his foes and rally his submissive base ... These verbal outbursts reinforce the president's dominance by reminding everybody of his wrath and his force.\"Primatologist Dame Jane Goodall explains that like the dominance performances of Trump, \"In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: Stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position.\" The comparison has been echoed by political observers sympathetic to Trump. Nigel Farage, an enthusiastic backer of Trump, stated that in the 2016 United States presidential debates where <b>Trump</b> loomed up on Clinton, he \"looked like a big silverback gorilla\", and added that \"he is that big alpha male. The leader of the pack!\"McAdams points out the audience gets to vicariously share in the sense of dominance due to the parasocial bonding that his performance produces for his fans, as shown by Shira Gabriel's research studying the phenomenon in Trump's role in The Apprentice. McAdams writes that the \"television audience vicariously experienced the world according to Donald Trump\", a world where <b>Trump</b> says \"Man is the most vicious of all animals, and life is a series of battles ending in victory or defeat.\" === Collective narcissism === Cultural anthropologist Paul Stoller thinks <b>Trump</b> masterfully employed the fundamentals of celebrity culture-glitz, illusion and fantasy to construct a shared alternate reality where lies become truth and reality's resistance to one's own dreams are overcome by the right attitude and bold self-confidence. Trump's father indoctrinated his children from an early age into the sort of positive thinking approach to reality advocated by the family's pastor Norman Vincent Peale. <b>Trump</b> boasted that Peale considered him the greatest student of his philosophy that regards facts as not important, because positive attitudes will instead cause what you \"image\" to materialize. <b>Trump</b> biographer Gwenda Blair thinks <b>Trump</b> took Peale's self-help philosophy and \"weaponized it\".Robert Jay Lifton, a scholar of psychohistory and authority on the nature of cults, emphasizes the importance of understanding Trumpism \"as an assault on reality\". A leader has more power if he is in any part successful at making truth irrelevant to his followers. <b>Trump</b> biographer Timothy L. O'Brien agrees, stating: \"It is a core operating principle of Trumpism. If you constantly attack objective reality, you are left as the only trustworthy source of information, which is one of his goals for his relationship with his supporters\u2014that they should believe no one else but him.\" Lifton believes <b>Trump</b> is a purveyor of a solipsistic reality which is hostile to facts and is made collective by amplifying frustrations and fears held by his community of zealous believers. Social psychologists refer to this as collective narcissism, a commonly held and strong emotional investment in the idea that one's group has a special status in society. It is often accompanied by chronic expressions of intolerance towards out-groups, intergroup aggression and frequent expressions of group victimhood whenever the in-group feels threatened by perceived criticisms or lack of proper respect for the in-group. Identity of group members is closely tied to the collective identity expressed by its leader, motivating multiple studies to examine its relationship to authoritarian movements. Collective narcissism measures have been shown to be a powerful predictor of membership in such movements including Trump's.In his book Believe Me which details Trump's exploitation of white evangelical politics of fear, Messiah College history professor John Fea points out the narcissistic nature of the fanciful appeals to nostalgia, noting that \"In the end, the practice of nostalgia is inherently selfish because it focuses entirely on our own experience of the past and not on the experience of others. For example, people nostalgic for the world of Leave It to Beaver may fail to recognize that other people, perhaps even some of the people living in the Cleaver's suburban \"paradise\" of the 1950s, were not experiencing the world in a way that they would describe as 'great.' Nostalgia can give us tunnel vision. Its selective use of the past fails to recognize the complexity and breadth of the human experience ... .\" According to Fea, the hopelessness of achieving such fanciful versions of an idealized past \"causes us to imagine a future filled with horror\" making anything unfamiliar the fodder for conspiratorial narratives that easily mobilize white evangelicals who cannot summon \"the kind of spiritual courage necessary to overcome fear.\" As a result, they not only embrace these fears but are easily captivated by a strongman such as <b>Trump</b> who repeats and amplifies their fears while posing as the deliverer from them. In his review of Fea's analysis of the impact of conspiracy theories on white evangelical <b>Trump</b> supporters, scholar of religious politics David Gutterman writes: \"The greater the threat, the more powerful the deliverance.\" Gutterman's view is that \"Donald J. <b>Trump</b> did not invent this formula; evangelicals have, in their lack of spiritual courage, demanded and gloried in this message for generations. Despite the literal biblical reassurance to 'fear not,' white evangelicals are primed for fear, their identity is stoked by fear, and the sources of fear are around every unfamiliar turn.Social theory scholar John Cash notes that disaster narratives of impending horrors have a broader audience than a single community whose identity is associated with specific collectively held certainties offered by white evangelical leaders, pointing to a 2010 Pew study which found that 41 percent of those in the US think that the world will either definitely or probably be destroyed by the middle of the century. Cash points out that certainties may be found in other narratives which also have the unifying effect of binding like minded individuals into shared \"us versus them\" narratives such as those based on race or political absolutisms.Cash notes that all political systems must endure some such exposure to the lure of narcissism, fantasy, illogicality and distortion. Cash thinks that psychoanalytic theorist Joel Whitebook is correct that \"Trumpism as a social experience can be understood as a psychotic like phenomenon, that \"[Trumpism is] an intentional [...] attack on our relation to reality.\" Whitebook thinks Trump's playbook is like that of Putin's strategist Vladislav Surkov who employs \"ceaseless shapeshifting, appealing to nationalist skinheads one moment and human rights groups the next.\"Cash makes comparisons to an Alice in Wonderland world when describing Trump's adept ability to hold a looking glass up to followers with disparate fantasies by seemingly embracing all of them in a series of contradictory tweets and pronouncements. Cash cites examples such as <b>Trump</b> appearing to support and encourage the \"very fine people\" among the \"neo-Nazi protestors [who] carried torches that were clear signifiers of a nostalgia\" after Charlottesville or for audiences with felt grievances about America's first black president, conspiracy fantasies such as the claim that Obama wiretapped him. Cash writes: \"Unlike the resilient Alice, who, having stepped through the looking-glass, insists on truth and accuracy when confronted by a world of reversals, contradictions, nonsense and irrationality, <b>Trump</b> reverses this process. Captivated by his own image and, hence, both unwilling and unable to step through the looking-glass for fear of disturbing and dissolving that narcissistic fascination with his preferred self-image, <b>Trump</b> has dragged the uninhibited and distorted world of the other side of the looking-glass into our shared world.\"Although the leader possesses dominant ownership of the reality shared by the group, Lifton sees important differences between Trumpism and typical cults, such as not advancing a totalist ideology and that isolation from the outside world is not used to preserve group cohesion. Lifton does identify multiple similarities with the kinds of cults disparaging the fake world that outsiders are deluded by in preference for their true reality\u2014a world that transcends the illusions and false information created by the cult's titanic enemies. Persuasion techniques similar to those of cults are used such as indoctrination employing constant echoing of catch phrases (via rally response, retweet, or Facebook share), or in participatory response to the guru's like utterances either in person or in online settings. Examples include the use of call and response (\"Clinton\" triggers \"lock her up\"; \"immigrants\" triggers \"build that wall\"; \"who will pay for it?\" triggers \"Mexico\"), thereby deepening the sense of participation with the transcendent unity between the leader and the community. Participants and observers at rallies have remarked on the special kind of liberating feeling that is often experienced which Lifton calls a \"high state\" that \"can even be called experiences of transcendence\". Conservative culture commentator David Brooks observes that under Trump, this post-truth mindset heavily reliant on conspiracy themes came to dominate Republican identity, providing its believers a sense of superiority since such insiders possess important information most people do not have. This results in an empowering sense of agency with the liberation, entitlement and group duty to reject \"experts\" and the influence of hidden cabals seeking to dominate them. Social media amplify the power of members to promote and expand their connections with like minded believers in insular alternate reality echo chambers. Social psychology and cognitive science research shows that individuals seek information and communities that confirm their views and that even those with critical thinking skills sufficient to identify false claims with non political material cannot do so when interpreting factual material that does not conform to political beliefs.While such media-enabled departures from shared, fact-based reality dates at least as far back as 1439 with the appearance of the Gutenberg press, what is new about social media is the personal bond created through direct and instantaneous communications from the leader, and the constant opportunity to repeat the messages and participate in the group identity signaling behavior. Prior to 2015, <b>Trump</b> already had firmly established this kind of parasocial bond with a substantial base of followers due to his repeated television and media appearances. For those sharing political views similar to his, Trump's use of Twitter to share his conspiratorial views caused those emotional bonds to intensify, causing his supporters to feel a deepened empathetic bond as with a friend\u2014sharing his anger, sharing his moral outrage, taking pride in his successes, sharing in his denial of failures and his oftentimes conspiratorial views. Given their effectiveness as an emotional tool, Brooks thinks such sharing of conspiracy theories has become the most powerful community bonding mechanism of the 21st century. Conspiracy theories usually have a strong political component and books such as Hofstadter's The Paranoid Style in American Politics describe the political efficacy of these alternate takes on reality. Some attribute Trump's political success to making such narratives a regular staple of Trumpist rhetoric, such as the purported rigging of the 2016 election to defeat Trump, that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, that Obama was not born in the United States, multiple conspiracy theories about the Clintons, that vaccines cause autism and so on. One of the most popular though disproven and discredited conspiracy theories is QAnon, which asserts that top Democrats run an elite child sex-trafficking ring and President <b>Trump</b> is making efforts to dismantle it. An October 2020 Yahoo-YouGov poll showed that these QAnon claims are mainstream, not fringe beliefs among <b>Trump</b> supporters, with both elements of the theory said to be true by fully half of <b>Trump</b> supporters polled.Some social psychologists see the predisposition of Trumpists towards interpreting social interactions in terms of dominance frameworks as extending to their relationship towards facts. A study by Felix Sussenbach and Adam B. Moore found that the dominance motive strongly correlated with hostility towards disconfirming facts and affinity for conspiracies among 2016 <b>Trump</b> voters but not among Clinton voters. Many critics note Trump's skill in exploiting narrative, emotion, and a whole host of rhetorical ploys to draw supporters into the group's common adventure as characters in a story much bigger than themselves.It is a story that involves not just a community-building call to arms to defeat titanic threats, or of the leader's heroic deeds restoring American greatness, but of a restoration of each supporter's individual sense of liberty and power to control their lives. <b>Trump</b> channels and amplifies these aspirations, explaining in one of his books that his bending of the truth is effective because it plays to people's greatest fantasies. By contrast, Clinton was dismissive of such emotion-filled storytelling and ignored the emotional dynamics of the Trumpist narrative. == Media and pillarization == === Culture industry === Peter E. Gordon, Alex Ross, sociologist David L. Andrews and Harvard political theorist David Lebow look on Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer's concept of the \"culture industry\" as useful for comprehending Trumpism. As Ross explains the concept, the culture industry replicates \"fascist methods of mass hypnosis ... blurring the line between reality and fiction,\" explaining, \"Trump is as much a pop-culture phenomenon as he is a political one.\" Gordon observes that these purveyors of popular culture are not just leveraging outrage, but are turning politics into a more commercially lucrative product, a \"polarized, standardized reflection of opinion into forms of humor and theatricalized outrage within narrow niche markets ... within which one swoons to one's preferred slogan and already knows what one knows. Name just about any political position and what sociologists call pillarization\u2014or what the Frankfurt School called \"ticket\" thinking\u2014will predict, almost without fail, a full suite of opinions.Trumpism is from Lebow's perspective, more of a result of this process than a cause. In the intervening years since Adorno's work, Lebow believes the culture industry has evolved into a politicizing culture market \"based increasingly on the internet, constituting a self-referential hyperreality shorn from any reality of referants ... sensationalism and insulation intensify intolerance of dissonance and magnify hostility against alternative hyperrealities. In a self-reinforcing logic of escalation, intolerance and hostility further encourage sensationalism and the retreat into insularity.\" From Gordon's view, \"Trumpism itself, one could argue, is just another name for the culture industry, where the performance of undoing repression serves as a means for carrying on precisely as before.\"From this viewpoint, the susceptibility to psychological manipulation of individuals with social dominance inclinations is not at the center of Trumpism, but is instead the \"culture industry\" which exploits these and other susceptibilities by using mechanisms that condition people to think in standardized ways. The burgeoning culture industry respects no political boundaries as it develops these markets with Gordon emphasizing \"This is true on the left as well as the right, and it is especially noteworthy once we countenance what passes for political discourse today. Instead of a public sphere, we have what J\u00fcrgen Habermas long ago called the refeudalization of society.\"What Kreiss calls an \"identity-based account of media\" is important for understanding Trump's success because \"citizens understand politics and accept information through the lens of partisan identity. ... The failure to come to grips with a socially embedded public and an identity group\u2013based democracy has placed significant limits on our ability to imagine a way forward for journalism and media in the <b>Trump</b> era. As Fox News and Breitbart have discovered, there is power in the claim of representing and working for particular publics, quite apart from any abstract claims to present the truth.\" === Profitability of spectacle and outrage === Examining trumpism as an entertainment product, some media research focuses on the heavy reliance on outrage discourse which in terms of media coverage privileged Trump's rhetoric over that of other candidates due to the symbiotic relationship between his focus on the entertainment value of such storytelling and the commercial interests of media companies. A unique form of incivility, the use of outrage narratives on political blogs, talk radio and cable news opinion shows had in the decades prior become representative of a relatively new political opinion media genre which had experienced significant growth due to its profitability.Media critic David Denby writes, \"Like a good standup comic, <b>Trump</b> invites the audience to join him in the adventure of delivering his act\u2014in this case, the barbarously entertaining adventure of running a Presidential campaign that insults everybody.\" Denby's claim is that <b>Trump</b> is simply good at delivering the kind of political entertainment product consumers demand. He observes that \"The movement's standard of allowable behavior has been formed by popular culture\u2014by standup comedy and, recently, by reality TV and by the snarking, trolling habits of the Internet. You can't effectively say that Donald <b>Trump</b> is vulgar, sensational, and buffoonish when it's exactly vulgar sensationalism and buffoonery that his audience is buying. Donald <b>Trump</b> has been produced by America.\"Although Trump's outrage discourse was characterized by fictional assertions, mean spirited attacks against various groups and dog whistle appeals to racial and religious intolerance, media executives could not ignore its profitability. CBS's CEO Les Moonves remarked that \"It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS,\" demonstrating how Trumpism's form of messaging and the commercial goals of media companies are not only compatible but mutually lucrative. Peter Wehner, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center considers <b>Trump</b> a political \"shock jock\" who \"thrives on creating disorder, in violating rules, in provoking outrage.\"The political profitability of incivility was demonstrated by the extraordinary amount of free airtime gifted to Trump's 2016 primary campaign\u2014estimated at two billion dollars, which according to media tracking companies grew to almost five billion by the end of the national campaign. The advantage of incivility was as true in social media, where \"a BuzzFeed analysis found that the top 20 fake election news stories emanating from hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs generated more engagement on Facebook (as measured by shares, reactions, and comments) than the top 20 election stories produced by 19 major news outlets combined, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, and NBC News.\" === Social media === Surveying research of how Trumpist communication is well suited to social media, Brian Ott writes that, \"commentators who have studied Trump's public discourse have observed speech patterns that correspond closely to what I identified as Twitter's three defining features [Simplicity, impulsivity, and incivility].\" Media critic Neal Gabler has a similar viewpoint writing that \"What FDR was to radio and JFK to television, <b>Trump</b> is to Twitter.\" Outrage discourse expert Patrick O'Callaghan argues that social media is most effective when it utilizes the particular type of communication which <b>Trump</b> relies on. O'Callaghan notes that sociologist Sarah Sobieraj and political scientist Jeffrey M. Berry almost perfectly described in 2011 the social media communication style used by <b>Trump</b> long before his presidential campaign.They explained that such discourse \"[involves] efforts to provoke visceral responses (e.g., anger, righteousness, fear, moral indignation) from the audience through the use of overgeneralizations, sensationalism, misleading or patently inaccurate information, ad hominem attacks, and partial truths about opponents, who may be individuals, organizations, or entire communities of interest (e.g., progressives or conservatives) or circumstance (e.g., immigrants). Outrage sidesteps the messy nuances of complex political issues in favor of melodrama, misrepresentative exaggeration, mockery, and improbable forecasts of impending doom. Outrage talk is not so much discussion as it is verbal competition, political theater with a scorecard.\" Due to Facebook's and Twitter's narrowcasting environment in which outrage discourse thrives, Trump's employment of such messaging at almost every opportunity was from O'Callaghan's account extremely effective because tweets and posts were repeated in viral fashion among like minded supporters, thereby rapidly building a substantial information echo chamber, a phenomenon Cass Sunstein identifies as group polarization, and other researchers refer to as a kind of self re-enforcing homophily. Within these information cocoons, it matters little to social media companies whether much of the information spread in such pillarized information silos is false, because as digital culture critic Olivia Solon points out, \"the truth of a piece of content is less important than whether it is shared, liked, and monetized.\"Citing Pew Research's survey that found 62% of US adults get their news from social media, Ott expresses alarm, \"since the 'news' content on social media regularly features fake and misleading stories from sources devoid of editorial standards.\" Media critic Alex Ross is similarly alarmed, observing, \"Silicon Valley monopolies have taken a hands-off, ideologically vacant attitude toward the upswelling of ugliness on the Internet,\" and that \"the failure of Facebook to halt the proliferation of fake news during the [Trump vs. Clinton] campaign season should have surprised no one. ... Traffic trumps ethics.\"O'Callaghan's analysis of Trump's use of social media is that \"outrage hits an emotional nerve and is therefore grist to the populist's or the social antagonist's mill. Secondly, the greater and the more widespread the outrage discourse, the more it has a detrimental effect on social capital. This is because it leads to mistrust and misunderstanding amongst individuals and groups, to entrenched positions, to a feeling of 'us versus them'. So understood, outrage discourse not only produces extreme and polarising views but also ensures that a cycle of such views continues. (Consider also in this context Wade Robison (2020) on the 'contagion of passion' and Cass Sunstein (2001, pp. 98\u2013136) on 'cybercascades'.)\" Ott agrees, stating that contagion is the best word to describe the viral nature of outrage discourse on social media, and writing that \"Trump's simple, impulsive, and uncivil Tweets do more than merely reflect sexism, racism, homophobia, and xenophobia; they spread those ideologies like a social cancer.\"Robison warns that emotional contagion should not be confused with the contagion of passions that James Madison and David Hume were concerned with. Robison states they underestimated the contagion of passions mechanism at work in movements, whose modern expressions include the surprising phenomena of rapidly mobilized social media supporters behind both the Arab Spring and the <b>Trump</b> presidential campaign writing, \"It is not that we experience something and then, assessing it, become passionate about it, or not\", and implying that \"we have the possibility of a check on our passions.\" Robison's view is that the contagion affects the way reality itself is experienced by supporters because it leverages how subjective certainty is triggered, so that those experiencing the contagiously shared alternate reality are unaware they have taken on a belief they should assess. == Similar movements, politicians and personalities == === Historical background in the United States === The roots of Trumpism in the United States can be traced to the Jacksonian era according to scholars Walter Russell Mead, Peter Katzenstein and Edwin Kent Morris. Eric Rauchway says: \"Trumpism\u2014nativism and white supremacy\u2014has deep roots in American history. But <b>Trump</b> himself put it to new and malignant purpose.\"Andrew Jackson's followers felt he was one of them, enthusiastically supporting his defiance of politically correct norms of the nineteenth century and even constitutional law when they stood in the way of public policy popular among his followers. Jackson ignored the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Worcester v. Georgia and initiated the forced Cherokee removal from their treaty protected lands to benefit white locals at the cost of between 2,000 and 6,000 dead Cherokee men, women, and children. Notwithstanding such cases of Jacksonian inhumanity, Mead's view is that Jacksonianism provides the historical precedent explaining the movement of followers of Trump, marrying grass-roots disdain for elites, deep suspicion of overseas entanglements, and obsession with American power and sovereignty, acknowledging that it has often been a xenophobic, \"whites only\" political movement. Mead thinks this \"hunger in America for a Jacksonian figure\" drives followers towards <b>Trump</b> but cautions that historically \"he is not the second coming of Andrew Jackson,\" observing that \"his proposals tended to be pretty vague and often contradictory,\" exhibiting the common weakness of newly elected populist leaders, commenting early in his presidency that \"now he has the difficulty of, you know, 'How do you govern?'\"Morris agrees with Mead, locating Trumpism's roots in the Jacksonian era from 1828 to 1848 under the presidencies of Jackson, Martin Van Buren and James K. Polk. On Morris's view, Trumpism also shares similarities with the post-World War I faction of the progressive movement which catered to a conservative populist recoil from the looser morality of the cosmopolitan cities and America's changing racial complexion. In his book The Age of Reform (1955), historian Richard Hofstadter identified this faction's emergence when \"a large part of the Progressive-Populist tradition had turned sour, became illiberal and ill-tempered.\" Prior to World War II, conservative themes of Trumpism were expressed in the America First Committee movement in the early 20th century, and after World War II were attributed to a Republican Party faction known as the Old Right. By the 1990s, it became referred to as the paleoconservative movement, which according to Morris has now been re-branded as Trumpism. Leo L\u00f6wenthal's book Prophets of Deceit (1949) summarized common narratives expressed in the post-World War II period of this populist fringe, specifically examining American demagogues of the period when modern mass media was married with the same destructive style of politics that historian Charles Clavey thinks Trumpism represents. According to Clavey, L\u00f6wenthal's book best explains the enduring appeal of Trumpism and offers the most striking historical insights into the movement.Writing in The New Yorker, journalist Nicholas Lemann states the post-war Republican Party ideology of fusionism, a fusion of pro-business party establishment with nativist, isolationist elements who gravitated towards the Republican and not the Democratic Party, later joined by Christian evangelicals \"alarmed by the rise of secularism\", was made possible by the Cold War and the \"mutual fear and hatred of the spread of Communism\". An article in Politico has referred to Trumpism as \"McCarthyism on steroids\".Championed by William F. Buckley Jr. and brought to fruition by Ronald Reagan in 1980, the fusion lost its glue with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which was followed by a growth of income inequality in the United States and globalization that \"created major discontent among middle and low income whites\" within and without the Republican Party. After the 2012 United States presidential election saw the defeat of Mitt Romney by Barack Obama, the party establishment embraced an \"autopsy\" report, titled the Growth and Opportunity Project, which \"called on the Party to reaffirm its identity as pro-market, government-skeptical, and ethnically and culturally inclusive.\"Ignoring the findings of the report and the party establishment in his campaign, <b>Trump</b> was \"opposed by more officials in his own Party ... than any Presidential nominee in recent American history,\" but at the same time he won \"more votes\" in the Republican primaries than any previous presidential candidate. By 2016, \"people wanted somebody to throw a brick through a plate-glass window\", in the words of political analyst Karl Rove. His success in the party was such that an October 2020 poll found 58% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents surveyed considered themselves supporters of <b>Trump</b> rather than the Republican Party. === Parallels with fascism and trend towards illiberal democracy === Trumpism has been likened to Machiavellianism and to Benito Mussolini's Italian Fascism. American historian Robert Paxton poses the question as to whether the democratic backsliding evident in Trumpism is fascism or not. As of 2017, Paxton believed it bore greater resemblance to plutocracy, a government which is controlled by a wealthy elite. Paxton changed his opinion following the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, and stated that it is \"not just acceptable but necessary\" to understand Trumpism as a form of fascism. Sociology professor Dylan John Riley calls Trumpism \"neo-Bonapartist patrimonialism\" because it does not capture the same mass movement appeal of classical fascism to be fascism.Argentine historian Federico Finchelstein believes significant intersections exist between Peronism and Trumpism because their mutual disregard for the contemporary political system (in the areas of both domestic and foreign policy) is discernible. American historian Christopher Browning considers the long-term consequences of Trump's policies and the support which he receives for them from the Republican Party to be potentially dangerous for democracy. In the German-speaking debate, the term initially appeared only sporadically, mostly in connection with the crisis of confidence in politics and the media and described the strategy of mostly right-wing political actors who wish to stir up this crisis in order to profit from it. German literature has a more diverse range of analysis of Trumpism.In How to Lose a Country: The 7 Steps from Democracy to Dictatorship, Turkish author Ece Temelkuran describes Trumpism as echoing a number of views and tactics which were expressed and used by the Turkish politician Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan during his rise to power. Some of these tactics and views are right-wing populism, demonization of the press, subversion of well-established and proven facts through the big lie (both historical and scientific), democratic backsliding such as dismantling judicial and political mechanisms; portraying systematic issues such as sexism or racism as isolated incidents, and crafting an ideal citizen.Political scientist Mark Blyth and his colleague Jonathan Hopkin believe strong similarities exist between Trumpism and similar movements towards illiberal democracies worldwide, but they do not believe Trumpism is a movement which is merely being driven by revulsion, loss, and racism. Hopkin and Blyth argue that both on the right and on the left the global economy is driving the growth of neo-nationalist coalitions which find followers who want to be free of the constraints which are being placed on them by establishment elites whose members advocate neoliberal economics and globalism.Others emphasize the lack of interest in finding real solutions to the social malaise which have been identified, and they also believe those individuals and groups who are executing policy are actually following a pattern which has been identified by sociology researchers like Leo L\u00f6wenthal and Norbert Guterman as originating in the post-World War II work of the Frankfurt School of social theory. Based on this perspective, books such as L\u00f6wenthal and Guterman's Prophets of Deceit offer the best insights into how movements like Trumpism dupe their followers by perpetuating their misery and preparing them to move further towards an illiberal form of government. === Rush Limbaugh === <b>Trump</b> is considered by some analysts to be following a blueprint of leveraging outrage, which was developed on partisan cable TV and talk radio shows such as the Rush Limbaugh radio show\u2014a style that transformed talk radio and American conservative politics decades before Trump. Both shared \"media fame\" and \"over-the-top showmanship\", and built an enormous fan base with politics-as-entertainment, attacking political and cultural targets in ways that would have been considered indefensible and beyond the pale in the years before them.Both featured \"the insults, the nicknames\" (for example, Limbaugh called preteen Chelsea Clinton the \"White House dog\", <b>Trump</b> mocked the looks of Ted Cruz's wife); conspiracy theories (Limbaugh claiming the 2010 Obamacare bill would empower \"death panels\" and \"euthanize\" elderly Americans, <b>Trump</b> claiming he won the 2020 election by a landslide but it was stolen from him); both maintained global warming was a hoax, Barack Obama was not a natural-born U.S. citizen, and the danger of COVID-19 was vastly exaggerated by liberals.Both attacked Black quarterbacks (Limbaugh criticizing Donovan McNabb, <b>Trump</b> Colin Kaepernick); both mocked people with disabilities, with Limbaugh flapping his arms in imitation of the Parkinson's disease of Michael J. Fox, and <b>Trump</b> doing the same to imitate the arthrogryposis of reporter Serge F. Kovaleski, although he later denied he had done so.Limbaugh, to whom <b>Trump</b> awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2020, preceded <b>Trump</b> in moving the Republican Party away from \"serious and substantive opinion leaders and politicians\", towards political provocation, entertainment, and anti-intellectualism, and popularizing and normalizing for \"many Republican politicians and voters\" what before his rise \"they might have thought\" but would have \"felt uncomfortable saying\". His millions of fans were intensely loyal and \"developed a capacity to excuse ... and deflect\" his statements no matter how offensive and outrageous, \"saying liberals were merely being hysterical or hateful. And many loved him even more for it.\" === Future impact === Writing in The Atlantic, Yaseem Serhan states Trump's post-impeachment claim that \"our historic, patriotic, and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun,\" should be taken seriously as Trumpism is a \"personality-driven\" populist movement, and other such movements\u2014such as Berlusconism in Italy, Peronism in Argentina and Fujimorism in Peru, \"rarely fade once their leaders have left office\". Bobby Jindal and Alex Castellanos wrote in Newsweek that separating Trumpism from Donald <b>Trump</b> himself was key to the Republican Party's future following his loss in the 2020 United States presidential election. == Foreign policy == In terms of foreign policy in the sense of Trump's \"America First\", unilateralism is preferred to a multilateral policy and national interests are particularly emphasized, especially in the context of economic treaties and alliance obligations. <b>Trump</b> has shown a disdain for traditional American allies such as Canada as well as transatlantic partners NATO and the European Union. Conversely, <b>Trump</b> has shown sympathy for autocratic rulers, such as Russian president Vladimir Putin, whom <b>Trump</b> often praised even before taking office, and during the 2018 Russia\u2013United States summit. The \"America First\" foreign policy includes promises by <b>Trump</b> to end American involvement in foreign wars, notably in the Middle East, while also issuing tighter foreign policy through sanctions against Iran, among other countries. == Economic policy == In terms of economic policy, Trumpism \"promises new jobs and more domestic investment\". Trump's hard line against export surpluses of American trading partners and general protectionist trade policies led to a tense situation in 2018 with mutually imposed punitive tariffs between the United States on the one hand and the European Union and China on the other. <b>Trump</b> secures the support of his political base with a policy that strongly emphasizes neo-nationalism and criticism of globalization. In contrast, the book Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America suggested that <b>Trump</b> \"radicalized economics\" to his base of white working- to middle-class voters by the promoting the idea that \"undeserving [minority] groups are getting ahead while their group is being left behind.\" == Beyond the United States == === Canada === According to Global News, Maclean's magazine, the National Observer, Toronto Star, and The Globe and Mail, there is Trumpism in Canada. In a November 2020 interview on The Current, immediately following the 2020 US elections, law professor Allan Rock, who served as Canada's attorney general and as Canada's ambassador to the U.N., described Trumpism and its potential impact on Canada. Rock said that even with Trump's losing the election, he had \"awakened something that won't go away\". He said it was something \"we can now refer to as Trumpism\"\u2014a force that he has \"harnessed\" <b>Trump</b> has \"given expression to an underlying frustration and anger, that arises from economic inequality, from the implications from globalisation.\"Rock cautioned that Canada must \"keep up its guard against the spread of Trumpism\", which he described as \"destabilizing\", \"crude\", \"nationalistic\", \"ugly\", \"divisive\", \"racist\", and \"angry\"; Rock added that one measurable impact on Canada of the \"overtly racist behaviour\" associated with Trumpism is that racists and white supremacists have become emboldened since 2016, resulting in a steep increase in the number of these organizations in Canada and a shockingly high increase in the rate of hate crimes in 2017 and 2018 in Canada.Maclean's and the Star, cited the research of Frank Graves who has been studying the rise of populism in Canada for a number of years. In a June 30, 2020 School of Public Policy journal article, he co-authored, the authors described a decrease in trust in the news and in journalists since 2011 in Canada, along with an increase in skepticism which \"reflects the emergent fake news convictions so evident in supporters of Trumpian populism.\" Graves and Smith wrote of the impact on Canada of a \"new authoritarian, or ordered, populism\" that resulted in the 2016 election of President Trump. They said 34% of Canadians hold a populist viewpoint\u2014most of whom are in Alberta and Saskatchewan\u2014who tend to be \"older, less-educated, and working-class\", are more likely to embrace \"ordered populism\", and are \"more closely aligned\" with conservative political parties. This \"ordered populism\" includes concepts such as a right-wing authoritarianism, obedience, hostility to outsiders, and strongmen who will take back the country from the \"corrupt elite\" and return it a better time in history, where there was more law and order. It is xenophobic, does not trust science, has no sympathy for equality issues related to gender and ethnicity, and is not part of a healthy democracy. The authors say this ordered populism had reached a \"critical force\" in Canada that is causing polarization and must be addressed.According to an October 2020 L\u00e9ger poll for 338Canada of Canadian voters, the number of \"pro-Trump conservatives\" has been growing in Canada's Conservative Party, which was under the leadership of Erin O'Toole at the time of the poll. Maclean's said this might explain O'Toole's \"True Blue\" social conservative campaign. The Conservative Party in Canada also includes \"centrist\" conservatives as well as Red Tories,\u2014also described as small-c conservative, centre-right or paternalistic conservatives as per the Tory tradition in the United Kingdom. O'Toole featured a modified version of Trump's slogan\u2014\"Take Back Canada\"\u2014in a video released as part of his official leadership candidacy platform. At the end of the video he called on Canadians to \"[j]oin our fight, let's take back Canada.\"In a September 8, 2020 CBC interview, when asked if his \"Canada First\" policy was different from Trump's \"America First\" policy, O'Toole said, \"No, it was not.\" In his August 24, 2019 speech conceding the victory of his successor Erin O'Toole as the newly elected leader of the Conservative Party, Andrew Scheer cautioned Canadians to not believe the \"narrative\" from mainstream media outlets but to \"challenge\" and \"double check ... what they see on TV on the internet\" by consulting \"smart, independent, objective organizations like The Post Millennial and True North. The Observer said Jeff Ballingall, who is the founder of the right-wing Ontario Proud, and is also the Chief Marketing Officer of The Post Millennial.Following the 2020 United States elections, National Post columnist and former newspaper \"magnate\", Conrad Black, who had had a \"decades-long\" friendship with Trump, and received a presidential pardon in 2019, in his columns, repeated Trump's \"unfounded claims of mass voter fraud\" suggesting that the election had been stolen. === Europe === Trumpism has also been said to be on the rise in Europe. Political parties such as the Finns Party, France's National Rally and Spain's far-right Vox party have been described as Trumpist in nature. Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon called Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \"Trump before Trump\". === Brazil === In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, sometimes referred to as the \"Brazilian Donald Trump\", who is often described as a right-wing extremist, sees <b>Trump</b> as a role model and according to Jason Stanley uses the same fascist tactics. Like Trump, Bolsonaro finds support among evangelicals for his views on culture war issues. Along with allies he publicly questioned Joe Biden's vote tally after the November election. === Nigeria === According to The Guardian and The Washington Post, there is a significant affinity towards <b>Trump</b> in Nigeria. Donald Trump's comments on the ethno-religious conflicts between Christians and the predominantly Muslim Fulani tribe has contributed to his popularity among Christians in Nigeria, in which he stated: \"We have had very serious problems with Christians who are being murdered in Nigeria. We are going to be working on that problem very, very hard because we cannot allow that to happen\". Donald <b>Trump</b> is praised by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a secessionist group that supports the independence of Biafra from Nigeria and is designated as a terrorist group by the Nigerian government. IPOB has claimed that he \"believes in the inalienable right of an indigenous people to self-determination\" and it also praised him for \"the direct and serious manner he addressed and demanded immediate end to the serial slaughter of Christians in Nigeria, especially Biafran Christians\".After Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election, IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu wrote a letter to <b>Trump</b> that claimed his victory placed upon him a \"historic and moral burden ... to liberate the enslaved nations in Africa\". As <b>Trump</b> was inaugurated in January 2017, IPOB organized a rally in support of <b>Trump</b> that resulted in violent clashes with Nigerian security forces and resulted in multiple deaths and arrests. On January 30, 2020, IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu attended a <b>Trump</b> rally in Iowa as a special VIP guest, at the invitation of the Republican Party of Iowa. According to a 2020 poll from Pew Research, 58% of Nigerians had favorable views of Donald Trump, the fourth highest percentage globally.According to John Campbell of Council on Foreign Relations, Trump's popularity in Nigeria can be explained by a \"manifestation of the widespread disillusionment in a country characterized by growing poverty, multiple security threats, an expanding crime wave, and a government seen as unresponsive and corrupt\", and his popularity is likely to be reflective of wealthier urban Nigerians rather than the majority of Nigerians who live in rural areas or urban slums and are unlikely to have strong opinions on Trump. === Iran === Donald <b>Trump</b> and his policy towards Iran has been praised by the Iranian opposition group 'Restart', which also supports American military action against Iran and offered to fight alongside Americans to overthrow the Iranian government. The group has adopted the slogan \"Make Iran Great Again\".Restart has been compared to QAnon by Ariane Tabatabai, in terms of \"conspiracist thinking going global\". Among conspiracy theories advocated by the group is that Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has died (or went into coma) in 2017 and a double plays his role in public. === Japan === In Japan, in a speech to Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers in Tokyo on 8 March 2019, Steve Bannon said that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is \"Trump before Trump\" and \"a great hero to the grassroots, the populist, and the nationalist movement throughout the world.\" Shinzo Abe is described as a \"right-wing nationalist\" or \"ultra-nationalist\", but whether he is a \"populist\" is controversial.Netto-uyoku is the term used to refer to netizens who espouse ultranationalist far-right views on Japanese social media, as well as in English to those who are proficient. Netto-uyoku are typically very friendly not only to Japanese nationalists but also to Donald Trump, and oppose liberal politics. They began spreading Trump's conspiracy theories in an attempt to overturn the 2020 American presidential election. === South Korea === The politics of Yoon Suk-yeol, the president of South Korea, has been called \"Trumpism\" for his right-wing populist elements. === Philippines === Sheila S. Coronel has argued that the political strategies of Ferdinand Marcos, who was President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, and Rodrigo Duterte, who held the same position from 2016 to 2022, share certain features with Trumpism, including disregard for facts, encouragement of fear, and a \"loud, bombastic, hypermasculine\" aesthetic; and that each has benefited from uncertain political environments. == See also == == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == === Books === === Articles ===", "summary": "Trumpism consists of the political ideologies or political movement associated with 45th U.S. president Donald <b>Trump</b> and his political base. Trumpists and Trumpians are terms used to refer to those exhibiting characteristics of Trumpism. Trumpism has been referred to as an authoritarian movement.The precise composition of Trumpism is sufficiently complex to overwhelm any single framework of analysis; it has been referred to as an American political variant of the far right and the national-populist and neo-nationalist sentiment seen in multiple nations worldwide from the late 2010s to the early 2020s. Though not strictly limited to any one party, <b>Trump</b> supporters became the largest faction of the Republican Party in the United States, with the remainder often characterized as \"the elite\" or \"the establishment\" in contrast. In response to the rise of Trump, anti-Trump elites formed a Never <b>Trump</b> movement. Some commentators have rejected the populist designation for Trumpism and view it instead as part of a trend towards a new form of fascism or neo-fascism, with some referring to it as explicitly fascist and others as authoritarian and illiberal. Others have more mildly identified it as a specific lite version of fascism in the United States. Some historians, including many of those using a new fascism classification, write of the hazards of direct comparisons with European fascist regimes of the 1930s, stating that while there are parallels, there are also important dissimilarities. Certain characteristics within public relations and Trump's political base have exhibited symptoms of a cult of personality.The label Trumpism has been applied to national-conservative and national-populist movements in other democracies, and many politicians outside of the United States have been labeled as staunch allies of <b>Trump</b> or Trumpism, or even as their country's equivalent to Trump, by various news agencies; among them are Jair Bolsonaro, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Jacob Zuma, Shinzo Abe, and Yoon Suk Yeol.", "Words": ["Trump"]}, {"title": "Presidency of Donald Trump", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "content": "Donald Trump's tenure as the 45th president of the United States began with his inauguration on January 20, 2017, and ended on January 20, 2021. Trump, a Republican from New York City, took office following his Electoral College victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, in which he lost the popular vote to Clinton by nearly three million votes. Upon his inauguration, he became the first president in American history without prior public office or military background. <b>Trump</b> made an unprecedented number of false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. His presidency ended with defeat in the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden after one term in office. <b>Trump</b> was unsuccessful in his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act but took measures to hinder its functioning and rescinded the individual mandate. <b>Trump</b> sought substantial spending cuts to major welfare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. He signed the Great American Outdoors Act, reversed numerous environmental regulations, and withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change. He signed the First Step Act on job training and early release of some federal prisoners and appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. In economic policy, he partially repealed the Dodd\u2013Frank Act and signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He enacted tariffs, triggering retaliatory tariffs from China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and signed the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement, a successor agreement to NAFTA. The federal deficit increased under <b>Trump</b> due to spending increases and tax cuts. He implemented a controversial family separation policy for migrants apprehended at the United States\u2013Mexico border. Trump's demand for the federal funding of a border wall resulted in the longest US government shutdown in history. He deployed federal law enforcement forces in response to the racial unrest in 2020. Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy was characterized by unilateral actions, disregarding traditional allies. The administration implemented a major arms sale to Saudi Arabia; denied citizens from several Muslim-majority countries entry into the United States; recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; and brokered the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and various Arab states. His administration withdrew United States troops from northern Syria, allowing Turkey to occupy the area. His administration also made a conditional deal with the Taliban to withdraw United States troops from Afghanistan in 2021. <b>Trump</b> met North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un three times. <b>Trump</b> withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement and later escalated tensions in the Persian Gulf by ordering the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani. Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019) concluded that Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and that while the prevailing evidence \"did not establish that members of the <b>Trump</b> campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government\", possible obstructions of justice occurred during the course of that investigation. <b>Trump</b> attempted to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rival Joe Biden, triggering his first impeachment by the House of Representatives on December 18, 2019, but he was acquitted by the Senate on February 5, 2020. <b>Trump</b> reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials in his messaging, and promoted misinformation about unproven treatments and the availability of testing. Following his loss in the 2020 presidential election to Biden, <b>Trump</b> refused to concede and initiated an extensive campaign to overturn the results, making false claims of widespread electoral fraud. On January 6, 2021, during a rally at the Ellipse, <b>Trump</b> urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and march to the Capitol, where the electoral votes were being counted by Congress in order to formalize Biden's victory. A mob of <b>Trump</b> supporters stormed the capitol, suspending the count and causing Vice President Mike Pence and other members of Congress to be evacuated. On January 13, the House voted to impeach <b>Trump</b> an unprecedented second time for \"incitement of insurrection\", but he was later acquitted by the Senate again on February 13, after he had already left office. <b>Trump</b> had historically low approval ratings, and scholars and historians rank his presidency as one of the worst in American history. == Election and inauguration == On November 9, 2016, Republicans Donald <b>Trump</b> of New York and Governor Mike Pence of Indiana won the 2016 election, defeating Democrats former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of New York and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. <b>Trump</b> won 304 electoral votes compared to Clinton's 227, though Clinton won a plurality of the popular vote, receiving nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump. <b>Trump</b> thus became the fifth person to win the presidency while losing the popular vote. In the concurrent congressional elections, Republicans maintained majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. <b>Trump</b> was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. He was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts. In his seventeen-minute inaugural address, <b>Trump</b> painted a dark picture of contemporary America, pledging to end \"American carnage\" caused by urban crime and saying America's \"wealth, strength, and confidence has dissipated\" by jobs lost overseas. He declared his strategy would be \"America First.\" The largest single-day protest in U.S. history, the Women's March, took place the day after his inauguration and was driven by opposition to <b>Trump</b> and his policies and views. == Administration == The <b>Trump</b> administration was characterized by record turnover, particularly among White House staff. By early 2018, 43% of senior White House positions had turned over. The administration had a higher turnover rate in the first two and a half years than the five previous presidents did over their entire terms.By October 2019, one in 14 of Trump's political appointees were former lobbyists; less than three years into his presidency, <b>Trump</b> had appointed more than four times as many lobbyists than predecessor Barack Obama did over the course of his first six years in office. Trump's cabinet included U.S. senator from Alabama Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, banker Steve Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary, retired Marine Corps general James Mattis as Defense Secretary, and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. <b>Trump</b> also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, such as neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations. === Cabinet === Days after the presidential election, <b>Trump</b> selected RNC Chairman Reince Priebus as his Chief of Staff. <b>Trump</b> chose Sessions for the position of Attorney General.In February 2017, <b>Trump</b> formally announced his cabinet structure, elevating the Director of National Intelligence and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to cabinet level. The Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, which had been added to the cabinet by Obama in 2009, was removed from the cabinet. Trump's cabinet consisted of 24 members, more than Obama at 23 or George W. Bush at 21.On February 13, 2017, <b>Trump</b> fired Michael Flynn from the post of National Security Advisor on grounds that he had lied to Vice President Pence about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak; Flynn later pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his contacts with Russia. Flynn was fired amidst the ongoing controversy concerning Russian interference in the 2016 election and accusations that Trump's electoral team colluded with Russian agents. In July 2017, John F. Kelly, who had served as secretary of Homeland Security, replaced Priebus as Chief of Staff. In September 2017, Tom Price resigned as Secretary of HHS amid criticism over his use of private charter jets for personal travel. Kirstjen Nielsen succeeded Kelly as Secretary in December 2017. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired via a tweet in March 2018; <b>Trump</b> appointed Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson and Gina Haspel to succeed Pompeo as the Director of the CIA. In the wake of a series of scandals, Scott Pruitt resigned as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in July 2018. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis informed <b>Trump</b> of his resignation following Trump's abrupt December 19, 2018, announcement that the remaining 2,000 American troops in Syria would be withdrawn, against the recommendations of his military and civilian advisors.Trump fired numerous inspectors general of agencies, including those who were probing the <b>Trump</b> administration and close <b>Trump</b> associates. In 2020, he fired five inspectors general in two months. The Washington Post wrote, \"For the first time since the system was created in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, inspectors general find themselves under systematic attack from the president, putting independent oversight of federal spending and operations at risk.\" === Dismissal of James Comey === <b>Trump</b> dismissed FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, saying he had accepted the recommendations of Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to dismiss Comey. Sessions's recommendation was based on Rosenstein's, while Rosenstein wrote that Comey should be dismissed for his handling of the conclusion of the FBI investigation into the Hillary Clinton email controversy. On May 10, <b>Trump</b> met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Based on White House notes of the meeting, <b>Trump</b> told the Russians, \"I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job ... I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.\" On May 11, <b>Trump</b> said in a videoed interview, \"... regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey ... in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with <b>Trump</b> and Russia is a made-up story.\" On May 18, Rosenstein told members of the U.S. Senate that he recommended Comey's dismissal while knowing <b>Trump</b> had already decided to fire Comey. In the aftermath of Comey's firing, the events were compared with those of the \"Saturday Night Massacre\" during Richard Nixon's administration and there was debate over whether <b>Trump</b> had provoked a constitutional crisis, as he had dismissed the man leading an investigation into Trump's associates. Trump's statements raised concerns of potential obstruction of justice. In Comey's memo about a February 2017 meeting with Trump, Comey said <b>Trump</b> attempted to persuade him to abort the investigation into Flynn. == Judicial appointments == After Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate in 2014, only 28.6 percent of judicial nominees were confirmed, \"the lowest percentage of confirmations from 1977 to 2018\". At the end of the Obama presidency, 105 judgeships were vacant. Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, prioritized confirming Trump's judicial appointees, doing so rapidly. By November 2018, <b>Trump</b> had appointed 29 judges to the U.S. courts of appeals, more than any modern president in the first two years of a presidential term.Trump ultimately appointed 226 Article III federal judges and 260 federal judges in total. His appointees, who were usually affiliated with the conservative Federalist Society, shifted the judiciary to the right. A third of Trump's appointees were under 45 years old when appointed, far higher than under previous presidents. Trump's judicial nominees were less likely to be female or ethnic minority than those of the previous administration. Of Trump's judicial appointments to the U.S. courts of appeals (circuit courts), two-thirds were white men, compared to 31% of Obama nominees and 63% of George W. Bush nominees. === Supreme Court nominations === <b>Trump</b> made three nominations to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett: <b>Trump</b> nominated Neil Gorsuch in January 2017 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, which had not been filled by Obama because the Republican-majority Senate did not consider the nomination of Merrick Garland. The Senate confirmed Gorsuch in a mostly party-line vote of 54\u201345 in April 2017. Gorsuch's confirmation was one of Trump's major first year accomplishments, made as part of a \"100\u2011day pledge\". <b>Trump</b> nominated Brett Kavanaugh in July 2018 to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was considered a key swing vote on the Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh in a mostly party-line vote of 50\u201348 in October 2018 after allegations that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape another student when they were both in high school; Kavanaugh denied the allegation. <b>Trump</b> nominated Amy Coney Barrett in September 2020 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg was considered part of the Court's liberal wing and her replacement with a conservative jurist substantially changed the ideological composition of the Supreme Court. Democrats opposed the nomination, arguing that the court vacancy should not be filled until after the 2020 presidential election. On October 26, 2020, the Senate confirmed Barrett by a mostly party-line vote of 52\u201348, with all Democrats opposing her confirmation. == Leadership style == Trump's own staffers, subordinates, and allies frequently characterized <b>Trump</b> as infantile. <b>Trump</b> reportedly eschewed reading detailed briefing documents, including the President's Daily Brief, in favor of receiving oral briefings. Intelligence briefers reportedly repeated the President's name and title in order to keep his attention. He was also known to acquire information by watching up to eight hours of television each day, most notably Fox News programs such as Fox & Friends and Hannity, whose broadcast talking points <b>Trump</b> sometimes repeated in public statements, particularly in early morning tweets. <b>Trump</b> reportedly expressed anger if intelligence analyses contradicted his beliefs or public statements, with two briefers stating they had been instructed by superiors to not provide <b>Trump</b> with information that contradicted his public statements.Trump had reportedly fostered chaos as a management technique, resulting in low morale and policy confusion among his staff. <b>Trump</b> proved unable to effectively compromise during the 115th U.S. Congress, which led to significant governmental gridlock and few notable legislative accomplishments despite Republican control of both houses of Congress. Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin found <b>Trump</b> lacked several traits of an effective leader, including \"humility, acknowledging errors, shouldering blame and learning from mistakes, empathy, resilience, collaboration, connecting with people and controlling unproductive emotions.\"In January 2018, Axios reported Trump's working hours were typically around 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (a later start and an earlier end compared to the beginning of his presidency) and that he was holding fewer meetings during his working hours in order to accommodate Trump's desire for more unstructured free time (labelled as \"executive time\"). In 2019, Axios published Trump's schedule from November 7, 2018, to February 1, 2019, and calculated that around sixty percent of the time between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. was \"executive time.\" === False and misleading statements === The number and scale of Trump's statements in public speeches, remarks, and tweets identified as false by scholars, fact-checkers, and commentators were characterized as unprecedented for an American president and even unprecedented in U.S. politics. The New Yorker called falsehoods a distinctive part of his political identity, and they have also been described by Republican political advisor Amanda Carpenter as a gaslighting tactic. His White House had dismissed the idea of objective truth and his campaign and presidency have been described as being \"post-truth\" and hyper-Orwellian. Trump's rhetorical signature included disregarding data from federal institutions that was incompatible to his arguments; quoting hearsay, anecdotal evidence, and questionable claims in partisan media; denying reality (including his own statements); and distracting when falsehoods were exposed.During the first year of Trump's presidency, The Washington Post's fact-checking team wrote that <b>Trump</b> was \"the most fact-challenged politician\" it had \"ever encountered ... the pace and volume of the president's misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up.\" As president, <b>Trump</b> made more than 5,000 false or misleading claims by September 2018, and by April 2020, <b>Trump</b> had made 18,000 false or misleading claims while in office, an average of more than 15 claims daily. The rate of Trump's false and misleading statements increased in the weeks preceding the 2018 midterm elections and in the first half of 2020. The most common false or misleading claims by <b>Trump</b> involved the economy and jobs, his border wall proposal, and his tax legislation; he had also made false statements regarding prior administrations as well as other topics, including crime, terrorism, immigration, Russia and the Mueller probe, the Ukraine probe, immigration, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Senior administration officials had also regularly given false, misleading, or tortured statements to the news media, which made it difficult for the news media to take official statements seriously. === Rule of law === Shortly before <b>Trump</b> secured the 2016 Republican nomination, The New York Times reported \"legal experts across the political spectrum say\" Trump's rhetoric reflected \"a constitutional worldview that shows contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law,\" adding \"many conservative and libertarian legal scholars warn that electing Mr. <b>Trump</b> is a recipe for a constitutional crisis.\" Political scientists warned that candidate Trump's rhetoric and actions mimicked those of other politicians who ultimately turned authoritarian once in office. Some scholars have concluded that during Trump's tenure as president and largely due to his actions and rhetoric, the U.S. has experienced democratic backsliding. Many prominent Republicans have expressed similar concerns that Trump's perceived disregard for the rule of law betrayed conservative principles.During the first two years of his presidency, <b>Trump</b> repeatedly sought to influence the Department of Justice to investigate Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, and Comey. He persistently repeated a variety of allegations, at least some of which had already been investigated or debunked. In spring 2018, <b>Trump</b> told White House counsel Don McGahn he wanted to order the Department of Justice to prosecute Clinton and Comey, but McGahn advised <b>Trump</b> such action would constitute abuse of power and invite possible impeachment. In May 2018, <b>Trump</b> demanded that the Department of Justice investigate \"whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the <b>Trump</b> Campaign for Political Purposes,\" which the Department of Justice referred to its inspector general. Although it is not unlawful for a president to exert influence on the Department of Justice to open an investigation, presidents have assiduously avoided doing so to prevent perceptions of political interference.Sessions resisted several demands by <b>Trump</b> and his allies for investigations of political opponents, causing <b>Trump</b> to repeatedly express frustration, saying at one point, \"I don't have an attorney general.\" While criticizing the special counsel investigation in July 2019, <b>Trump</b> falsely claimed that the Constitution ensures that \"I have to the right to do whatever I want as president.\" <b>Trump</b> had on multiple occasions either suggested or promoted views of extending his presidency beyond normal term limits.Trump frequently criticized the independence of the judiciary for unfairly interfering in his administration's ability to decide policy. In November 2018, in an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting president, Roberts criticized Trump's characterization of a judge who had ruled against his policies as an \"Obama judge,\" adding \"That's not law.\" In October 2020, twenty Republican former U.S. attorneys, among them appointees by each Republican president since Eisenhower, characterized <b>Trump</b> as \"a threat to the rule of law in our country.\" Greg Brower, who worked in the <b>Trump</b> administration, asserted, \"It's clear that President <b>Trump</b> views the Justice Department and the FBI as his own personal law firm and investigative agency.\" === Relationship with the news media === Early into his presidency, <b>Trump</b> developed a highly contentious relationship with the news media, repeatedly referring to them as the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people.\" As a candidate, <b>Trump</b> had refused press credentials for offending publications but said he would not do so if elected. <b>Trump</b> both privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' White House press credentials. At the same time, the <b>Trump</b> White House gave temporary press passes to far-right pro-Trump fringe outlets, such as InfoWars and The Gateway Pundit, which are known for publishing hoaxes and conspiracy theories.On his first day in office, <b>Trump</b> falsely accused journalists of understating the size of the crowd at his inauguration and called the news media \"among the most dishonest human beings on earth.\" Trump's claims were notably defended by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who claimed the inauguration crowd had been the biggest in history, a claim disproven by photographs. Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway then defended Spicer when asked about the falsehood, saying it was an \"alternative fact\", not a falsehood.The administration frequently sought to punish and blocked access for reporters that broke stories about the administration. <b>Trump</b> frequently criticized right-wing media outlet Fox News for being insufficiently supportive of him, threatening to lend his support for alternatives to Fox News on the right. On August 16, 2018, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming that \"the press is not the enemy of the people.\"The relationship between Trump, the news media, and fake news has been studied. One study found that between October 7 and November 14, 2016, while one in four Americans visited a fake news website, \"Trump supporters visited the most fake news websites, which were overwhelmingly pro-Trump\" and \"almost 6 in 10 visits to fake news websites came from the 10% of people with the most conservative online information diets.\" Brendan Nyhan, one of the authors of the study, said in an interview, \"People got vastly more misinformation from Donald <b>Trump</b> than they did from fake news websites.\" In October 2018, <b>Trump</b> praised U.S. Representative Greg Gianforte for assaulting political reporter Ben Jacobs in 2017. According to analysts, the incident marked the first time the president has \"openly and directly praised a violent act against a journalist on American soil.\" Later that month, as CNN and prominent Democrats were targeted with mail bombs, <b>Trump</b> initially condemned the bomb attempts but shortly thereafter blamed the \"Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News\" for causing \"a very big part of the anger we see today in our society.\"The <b>Trump</b> Justice Department obtained by court order the 2017 phone logs or email metadata of reporters from CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed, and Politico as part of investigations into leaks of classified information. === Twitter === <b>Trump</b> continued his use of Twitter following the presidential campaign. He continued to personally tweet from @realDonaldTrump, his personal account, while his staff tweet on his behalf using the official @POTUS account. His use of Twitter was unconventional for a president, with his tweets initiating controversy and becoming news in their own right. Some scholars have referred to his time in office as the \"first true Twitter presidency.\" The <b>Trump</b> administration described Trump's tweets as \"official statements by the President of the United States.\" The federal judge Naomi Reice Buchwald ruled in 2018 that Trump's blocking of other Twitter users due to opposing political views violated the First Amendment and he must unblock them. The ruling was upheld on appeal. His tweets have been reported as ill-considered, impulsive, vengeful, and bullying, often being made late at night or in the early hours of the morning. His tweets about a Muslim ban were successfully turned against his administration to halt two versions of travel restrictions from some Muslim-majority countries. He has used Twitter to threaten and intimidate his political opponents and potential political allies needed to pass bills. Many tweets appear to be based on stories <b>Trump</b> has seen in the media, including far-right news websites such as Breitbart and television shows such as Fox & Friends.Trump used Twitter to attack federal judges who ruled against him in court cases and to criticize officials within his own administration, including then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, then-National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and, at various times, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Tillerson was eventually fired via a tweet by Trump. <b>Trump</b> also tweeted that his Justice Department is part of the American \"deep state\"; that \"there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State\" Departments; and that the special counsel investigation is a \"WITCH HUNT!\" In August 2018, <b>Trump</b> used Twitter to write that Attorney General Jeff Sessions \"should stop\" the special counsel investigation immediately; he also referred to it as \"rigged\" and its investigators as biased. In February 2020, <b>Trump</b> tweeted criticism of the prosecutors' proposed sentence for Trump's former aide Roger Stone. A few hours later, the Justice Department replaced the prosecutors' proposed sentence with a lighter proposal. This gave the appearance of presidential interference in a criminal case and caused a strong negative reaction. All four of the original prosecutors withdrew from the case; more than a thousand former Department of Justice lawyers signed a letter condemning the action. On July 10, <b>Trump</b> commuted the sentence of Stone days before he was due to report to prison.In response to the mid-2020 George Floyd protests, some of which resulted in looting, <b>Trump</b> tweeted on May 25 that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Not long after, Twitter restricted the tweet for violating the company's policy on promoting violence. On May 28, <b>Trump</b> signed an executive order which sought to limit legal protections of social media companies.On January 8, 2021, Twitter announced that they had permanently suspended Trump's personal account \"due to the risk of further incitement of violence\" following the Capitol attack. <b>Trump</b> announced in his final tweet before the suspension that he would not attend the inauguration of Joe Biden. Other social media platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube and others also suspended the official handles of Donald Trump. == Domestic affairs == === Agriculture === Due to Trump's trade tariffs combined with depressed commodities prices, American farmers faced the worst crisis in decades. <b>Trump</b> provided farmers $12 billion in direct payments in July 2018 to mitigate the negative impacts of his tariffs, increasing the payments by $14.5 billion in May 2019 after trade talks with China ended without agreement. Most of the administration's aid went to the largest farms. Politico reported in May 2019 that some economists in the United States Department of Agriculture were being punished for presenting analyses showing farmers were being harmed by Trump's trade and tax policies, with six economists having more than 50 years of combined experience at the Service resigning on the same day. Trump's fiscal 2020 budget proposed a 15% funding cut for the Agriculture Department, calling farm subsidies \"overly generous\". === Consumer protections === The administration reversed a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that had made it easier for aggrieved consumers to pursue class actions against banks; the Associated Press characterized the reversal as a victory for Wall Street banks. Under Mick Mulvaney's tenure, the CFPB reduced enforcement of rules that protected consumers from predatory payday lenders. <b>Trump</b> scrapped a proposed rule from the Obama administration that airlines disclose baggage fees. <b>Trump</b> reduced enforcement of regulations against airlines; fines levied by the administration in 2017 were less than half of what the Obama administration did the year before. === Criminal justice === The New York Times summarized the <b>Trump</b> administration's \"general approach to law enforcement\" as \"cracking down on violent crime\", \"not regulating the police departments that fight it\", and overhauling \"programs that the Obama administration used to ease tensions between communities and the police\". <b>Trump</b> reversed a ban on providing federal military equipment to local police departments and reinstated the use of civil asset forfeiture. The administration stated that it would no longer investigate police departments and publicize their shortcomings in reports, a policy previously enacted under the Obama administration. Later, <b>Trump</b> falsely claimed that the Obama administration never tried to reform the police.In December 2017, Sessions and the Department of Justice rescinded a 2016 guideline advising courts against imposing large fines and fees on poor defendants. Despite Trump's pro-police rhetoric, his 2019 budget plan proposed nearly fifty percent cuts to the COPS Hiring Program which provides funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to help hire community policing officers. <b>Trump</b> appeared to advocate police brutality in a July 2017 speech to police officers, prompting criticism from law enforcement agencies. In 2020, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the <b>Trump</b> administration for reducing police oversight and eroding public confidence in law enforcement.In December 2018, <b>Trump</b> signed the First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill which sought to rehabilitate prisoners and reduce recidivism, notably by expanding job training and early-release programs, and lowering mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.The number of prosecutions of child-sex traffickers has showed a decreasing trend under the <b>Trump</b> administration relative to the Obama administration. Under the <b>Trump</b> administration, the SEC charged the fewest number of insider trading cases since the Reagan administration. ==== Presidential pardons and commutations ==== During his presidency, <b>Trump</b> pardoned or commuted the sentences of 237 individuals. Most of those pardoned had personal or political connections to Trump. A significant number had been convicted of fraud or public corruption. <b>Trump</b> circumvented the typical clemency process, taking no action on more than ten thousand pending applications, using the pardon power primarily on \"public figures whose cases resonated with him given his own grievances with investigators\". ==== Drug policy ==== In a May 2017 departure from the policy of the Department of Justice under Obama to reduce long jail sentencing for minor drug offenses and contrary to a growing bipartisan consensus, the administration ordered federal prosecutors to seek maximum sentencing for drug offenses. In a January 2018 move that created uncertainty regarding the legality of recreational and medical marijuana, Sessions rescinded a federal policy that had barred federal law enforcement officials from aggressively enforcing federal cannabis law in states where the drug is legal. The administration's decision contradicted then-candidate Trump's statement that marijuana legalization should be \"up to the states\". That same month, the VA said it would not research cannabis as a potential treatment against PTSD and chronic pain; veterans organizations had pushed for such a study. In December 2018, <b>Trump</b> signed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, which included de-scheduling certain cannabis products, leading to a rise in legal Delta-8-- a step which resembled legalization. ==== Capital punishment ==== During Trump's term (in 2020 and in January 2021), the federal government executed thirteen people in 2020 and January 2021; the first executions since 2002. In this time period, <b>Trump</b> oversaw more federal executions than any president in the preceding 120 years. === Disaster relief === ==== Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria ==== Three hurricanes hit the U.S. in August and September 2017: Harvey in southeastern Texas, Irma on the Florida Gulf coast, and Maria in Puerto Rico. <b>Trump</b> signed into law $15 billion in relief for Harvey and Irma, and later $18.67 billion for all three. The administration came under criticism for its delayed response to the humanitarian crisis on Puerto Rico. Politicians of both parties had called for immediate aid for Puerto Rico, and criticized <b>Trump</b> for focusing on a feud with the National Football League instead. <b>Trump</b> did not comment on Puerto Rico for several days while the crisis was unfolding. According to The Washington Post, the White House did not feel a sense of urgency until \"images of the utter destruction and desperation \u2013 and criticism of the administration's response \u2013 began to appear on television.\" <b>Trump</b> dismissed the criticism, saying distribution of necessary supplies was \"doing well\". The Washington Post noted, \"on the ground in Puerto Rico, nothing could be further from the truth.\" <b>Trump</b> also criticized Puerto Rico officials. A BMJ analysis found the federal government responded much more quickly and on a larger scale to the hurricane in Texas and Florida than in Puerto Rico, despite the fact that the hurricane in Puerto Rico was more severe. A 2021 HUD Inspector General investigation found that the <b>Trump</b> administration erected bureaucratic hurdles which stalled approximately $20 billion in hurricane relief for Puerto Rico.At the time of FEMA's departure from Puerto Rico, one third of Puerto Rico residents still lacked electricity and some places lacked running water. A New England Journal of Medicine study estimated the number of hurricane-related deaths during the period September 20 to December 31, 2017, to be around 4,600 (range 793\u20138,498) The official death rate due to Maria reported by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is 2,975; the figure was based on an independent investigation by George Washington University commissioned by the governor of Puerto Rico. <b>Trump</b> falsely claimed the official death rate was wrong, and said the Democrats were trying to make him \"look as bad as possible\". ==== California wildfires ==== <b>Trump</b> misleadingly blamed the destructive wildfires in 2018 in California, on \"gross\" and \"poor\" \"mismanagement\" of forests by California, saying there was no other reason for these wildfires. The fires in question were not \"forest fires\"; most of the forest was owned by federal agencies; and climate change in part contributed to the fires.In September 2020, California's worst wildfires in history prompted <b>Trump</b> to visit the state. In a briefing to state officials, <b>Trump</b> said that federal assistance was necessary, and again baselessly asserted that the lack of forestry, not climate change, is the underlying cause of the fires. === Economy === Trump's economic policies have centered on cutting taxes, deregulation, and trade protectionism. <b>Trump</b> primarily stuck to or intensified traditional Republican economic policy positions that benefitted corporate interests or the affluent, with the exception of his trade protectionist policies. Deficit spending, combined with tax cuts for the wealthy, caused the U.S. national debt to sharply increase.One of Trump's first actions was to indefinitely suspend a cut in fee rates for federally-insured mortgages implemented by the Obama administration which saved individuals with lower credit scores around $500 per year on a typical loan. Upon taking office, <b>Trump</b> halted trade negotiations with the European Union on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which had been underway since 2013.The administration proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), which if implemented would lead millions to lose access to food stamps and limit the amount of benefits for remaining recipients.During his tenure, <b>Trump</b> repeatedly sought to intervene in the economy to affect specific companies and industries. <b>Trump</b> sought to compel power grid operators to buy coal and nuclear energy, and sought tariffs on metals to protect domestic metal producers. <b>Trump</b> also publicly attacked Boeing and Lockheed Martin, sending their stocks tumbling. <b>Trump</b> repeatedly singled out Amazon for criticism and advocated steps that would harm the company, such as ending an arrangement between Amazon and the United States Postal Service (USPS) and raising taxes on Amazon. <b>Trump</b> expressed opposition to the merger between Time Warner (the parent company of CNN) and AT&T.The <b>Trump</b> campaign ran on a policy of reducing America's trade deficit, particularly with China. The overall trade deficit increased during Trump's presidency. The goods deficit with China reached a record high for the second consecutive year in 2018.A 2021 study, which used the synthetic control method, found no evidence <b>Trump</b> had an impact on the U.S. economy during his time in office. Analysis conducted by Bloomberg News at the end of Trump's second year in office found that his economy ranked sixth among the last seven presidents, based on fourteen metrics of economic activity and financial performance. <b>Trump</b> repeatedly and falsely characterized the economy during his presidency as the best in American history. In February 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. entered a recession. ==== Taxation ==== In September 2017, <b>Trump</b> proposed the most sweeping federal tax overhaul in many years. <b>Trump</b> signed the tax legislation on December 22, 2017, after it passed Congress on party-line votes. The tax bill was the first major legislation signed by Trump. The $1.5 trillion bill reduced the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, its lowest point since 1939. The bill also cut the individual tax rate, reducing the top rate from 39.6% to 37%, although these individual tax cuts expire after 2025; as a result, \"by 2027, every income group making less than $75,000 would see a net tax increase.\" The bill doubled the estate tax exemption (to $22 million for married couples); and allowed the owners of pass-through businesses to deduct 20% of business income. The bill doubled the standard deduction while eliminating many itemized deductions, including the deduction for state and local taxes. The bill also repeated the individual health insurance mandate contained in the Affordable Care Act.According to The New York Times, the plan would result in a \"huge windfall\" for the very wealthy but would not benefit those in the bottom third of the income distribution. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the richest 0.1% and 1% would benefit the most in raw dollar amounts and percentage terms from the tax plan, earning 10.2% and 8.5% more income after taxes respectively. Middle-class households would on average earn 1.2% more after tax, but 13.5% of middle class households would see their tax burden increase. The poorest fifth of Americans would earn 0.5% more. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued that the corporate income tax cut would benefit workers the most, while the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office and many economists estimated that owners of capital would benefit vastly more than workers. A preliminary estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the tax plan would add more than $2 trillion over the next decade to the federal debt, while the Tax Policy Center found that it would add $2.4 trillion to the debt. A 2019 Congressional Research Service analysis found that the tax cuts had \"a relatively small (if any) first-year\" growth effect on the economy. A 2019 analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget concluded that Trump's policies will add $4.1 trillion to the national debt from 2017 to 2029. Around $1.8 trillion of debt is projected to eventually arise from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ==== Trade ==== In March 2018, <b>Trump</b> imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines of 30\u201350%. In March 2018, he imposed tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) from most countries, which covered an estimated 4.1% of U.S. imports. On June 1, 2018, this was extended to the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. In separate moves, the <b>Trump</b> administration has set and escalated tariffs on goods imported from China, leading to a trade war. The tariffs angered trading partners, who implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, and adversely affected real income and GDP. A CNBC analysis found that <b>Trump</b> \"enacted tariffs equivalent to one of the largest tax increases in decades\", while Tax Foundation and Tax Policy Center analyses found the tariffs could wipe out the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for many households. The two countries reached a \"phase one\" truce agreement in January 2020. The bulk of the tariffs remained in place until talks were to resume after the 2020 election. <b>Trump</b> provided $28 billion in cash aid to farmers affected by the trade war. Studies have found that the tariffs also adversely affected Republican candidates in elections. An analysis published by The Wall Street Journal in October 2020 found the trade war did not achieve the primary objective of reviving American manufacturing, nor did it result in the reshoring of factory production.Three weeks after Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, wrote an April 2019 Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled \"Trump's Tariffs End or His Trade Deal Dies\", stating \"Congress won't approve USMCA while constituents pay the price for Mexican and Canadian retaliation,\" <b>Trump</b> lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Two weeks later, <b>Trump</b> unexpectedly announced he would impose a 5% tariff on all imports from Mexico on June 10, increasing to 10% on July 1, and by another 5% each month for three months, \"until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP\". Grassley commented the move as a \"misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent\". That same day, the <b>Trump</b> administration formally initiated the process to seek congressional approval of USMCA. Trump's top trade advisor, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, opposed the new Mexican tariffs on concerns it would jeopardize passage of USMCA. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and <b>Trump</b> senior advisor Jared Kushner also opposed the action. Grassley, whose committee is instrumental in passing USMCA, was not informed in advance of Trump's surprise announcement. On June 7, <b>Trump</b> announced the tariffs would be \"indefinitely suspended\" after Mexico agreed to take actions, including deploying its National Guard throughout the country and along its southern border. The New York Times reported the following day that Mexico had actually agreed to most of the actions months earlier.As a presidential candidate in 2016, <b>Trump</b> pledged to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement with eleven Pacific Rim nations which the United States had signed earlier that year. China was not a party to the agreement, which was intended to allow the United States to guide trade relations in the region. He incorrectly asserted the deal was flawed because it contained a \"back door\" that would allow China to enter the agreement later. <b>Trump</b> announced the American withdrawal from the deal days after taking office. Upon the American withdrawal, the remaining partners renamed it the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. In September 2021, China formally applied to join that agreement in an effort to replace the United States as its hub; China's state-run Global Times said the move would \"cement the country's leadership in global trade\" and leave the United States \"increasingly isolated.\" === Education === <b>Trump</b> appointed Betsy DeVos as his Secretary of Education. Her nomination was confirmed on a 50\u201350 Senate vote with Vice President Pence called upon to break the tie (the first time a vice president had cast a tie-breaking vote on a Cabinet nomination). Democrats opposed DeVos as underqualified, while Republicans supported DeVos because of her strong support of school choice.In 2017, <b>Trump</b> revoked an Obama administration memo which provided protections for people in default on student loans. The United States Department of Education cancelled agreements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to police student loan fraud. The administration rescinded a regulation restricting federal funding to for-profit colleges unable to demonstrate that college graduates had a reasonable debt-to-earnings ratio after entering the job market. Seth Frotman, the CFPB student loan ombudsman, resigned, accusing the <b>Trump</b> administration of undermining the CFPB's work on protecting student borrowers. DeVos marginalized an investigative unit within the Department of Education that under Obama investigated predatory activities by for-profit colleges. An investigation started under Obama into the practices of DeVry Education Group, which operates for-profit colleges, was halted in early 2017, and the former dean at DeVry was made into the supervisor for the investigative unit later that summer. DeVry paid a $100 million fine in 2016 for defrauding students.In 2017, DeVos said the Obama administration's guidance for how campuses address sexual assault \"failed too many students\" and she announced that she intended to replace the current approach \"with a workable, effective and fair system\". Consequently, the administration scrapped an Obama administration guidance on how schools and universities should combat sexual harassment and sexual violence. DeVos criticized the guidance for undermining the rights of those accused of sexual harassment. === Election integrity === On the eve of the 2018 midterm elections, Politico described the <b>Trump</b> administration's efforts to combat election propaganda as \"rudderless\". At the same time, U.S. intelligence agencies warned about \"ongoing campaigns\" by Russia, China, and Iran to influence American elections. === Energy === The administration's \"America First Energy Plan\" did not mention renewable energy and instead focused on fossil fuels. The administration enacted 30% tariffs on imported solar panels. The American solar energy industry is highly reliant on foreign parts (80% of parts are made abroad); as a result, the tariffs could raise the costs of solar energy, reduce innovation and reduce jobs in the industry \u2013 which in 2017 employed nearly four times as many American workers as the coal industry. The administration reversed standards put in place to make commonly used lightbulbs more energy-efficient.Trump rescinded a rule requiring oil, gas and mining firms to disclose how much they paid foreign governments, and withdrew from the international Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) which required disclosure of payments by oil, gas and mining companies to governments.In 2017, <b>Trump</b> ordered the reversal of an Obama-era ban on new oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean and environmentally sensitive areas of the North Atlantic coast, in the Outer Continental Shelf. Trump's order was halted by a federal court, which ruled in 2019 that it unlawfully exceeded his authority. <b>Trump</b> also revoked the 2016 Well Control Rule, a safety regulation adopted after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; this action is the subject of legal challenges from environmental groups. In January 2018, the administration singled out Florida for exemption from the administration's offshore drilling plan. The move stirred controversy because it came after Florida Governor Rick Scott, who was considering a 2018 Senate run, complained about the plan. The move raised ethical questions about the appearance of \"transactional favoritism\" because <b>Trump</b> owns a coastal resort in Florida, and because of the state's status as a crucial \"swing state\" in the 2020 presidential election. Other states sought similar offshore drilling exemptions, and litigation ensued.Despite rhetoric about boosting the coal industry, coal-fueled electricity generating capacity declined faster during Trump's presidency than during any previous presidential term, falling 15% with the idling of 145 coal-burning units at 75 power plants. An estimated 20% of electricity was expected to be generated by coal in 2020, compared to 31% in 2017. === Environment === By October 2020, the administration had overturned 72 environmental regulations and was in process of reversing an additional 27. A 2018 American Journal of Public Health study found that in Trump's first six months in office, the United States Environmental Protection Agency adopted a pro-business attitude unlike that of any previous administration, as it \"moved away from the public interest and explicitly favored the interests of the regulated industries\".Analyses of EPA enforcement data showed that the <b>Trump</b> administration brought fewer cases against polluters, sought a lower total of civil penalties and made fewer requests of companies to retrofit facilities to curb pollution than the Obama and Bush administrations. According to The New York Times, \"confidential internal E.P.A. documents show that the enforcement slowdown coincides with major policy changes ordered by Mr. Pruitt's team after pleas from oil and gas industry executives.\" In 2018, the administration referred the lowest number of pollution cases for criminal prosecution in 30 years. Two years into Trump's presidency, The New York Times wrote he had \"unleashed a regulatory rollback, lobbied for and cheered on by industry, with little parallel in the past half-century\". In June 2018, David Cutler and Francesca Dominici of Harvard University estimated conservatively that the <b>Trump</b> administration's modifications to environmental rules could result in more than 80,000 additional U.S. deaths and widespread respiratory ailments. In August 2018, the administration's own analysis showed that loosening coal plant rules could cause up to 1,400 premature deaths and 15,000 new cases of respiratory problems. From 2016 to 2018, air pollution increased by 5.5%, reversing a seven-year trend where air pollution had declined by 25%.All references to climate change were removed from the White House website, with the sole exception of mentioning Trump's intention to eliminate the Obama administration's climate change policies. The EPA removed climate change material on its website, including detailed climate data. In June 2017, <b>Trump</b> announced U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, a 2015 climate change accord reached by 200 nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2017, <b>Trump</b> \u2013 who had repeatedly called scientific consensus on climate a \"hoax\" before becoming president \u2013 falsely implied that cold weather meant climate change was not occurring. Through executive order, <b>Trump</b> reversed multiple Obama administration policies meant to tackle climate change, such as a moratorium on federal coal leasing, the Presidential Climate Action Plan, and guidance for federal agencies on taking climate change into account during National Environmental Policy Act action reviews. <b>Trump</b> also ordered reviews and possibly modifications to several directives, such as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), the estimate for the \"social cost of carbon\" emissions, carbon dioxide emission standards for new coal plants, methane emissions standards from oil and natural gas extraction, as well as any regulations inhibiting domestic energy production. The administration rolled back regulations requiring the federal government to account for climate change and sea-level rise when building infrastructure. The EPA disbanded a 20-expert panel on pollution which advised the EPA on the appropriate threshold levels to set for air quality standards. The administration has repeatedly sought to reduce the EPA budget. The administration invalidated the Stream Protection Rule, which limited dumping of toxic wastewater containing metals, such as arsenic and mercury, into public waterways, regulations on coal ash (carcinogenic leftover waste produced by coal plants), and an Obama-era executive order on protections for oceans, coastlines and lakes enacted in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The administration refused to act on recommendations from EPA scientists urging greater regulation of particulate pollution.The administration rolled back major Clean Water Act protections, narrowing the definition of the \"waters of the United States\" under federal protection. Studies by the Obama-era EPA suggest that up to two-thirds of California's inland freshwater streams would lose protections under the rule change. The EPA sought to repeal a regulation which required oil and gas companies to restrict emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The EPA rolled back automobile fuel efficiency standards introduced in 2012. The EPA granted a loophole allowing a small set of trucking companies to skirt emissions rules and produce glider trucks that emit 40 to 55 times the air pollutants of other new trucks. The EPA rejected a ban on the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos; a federal court then ordered the EPA to ban chlorpyrifos, because the EPA's own extensive research showed it caused adverse health effects in children. The administration scaled back the ban on the use of the solvent methylene chloride, and lifted a rule requiring major farms to report pollution emitted through animal waste.The administration suspended funding on several environmental research studies, a multi-million-dollar program that distributed grants for research the effects of chemical exposure on children and $10-million-a-year research line for NASA's Carbon Monitoring System. including an unsuccessful attempt to kill aspects of NASA's climate science program.The EPA expedited the process for approving new chemicals and made the process of evaluating the safety of those chemicals less stringent; EPA scientists expressed concerns that the agency's ability to stop hazardous chemicals was being compromised. Internal emails showed that Pruitt aides prevented the publication of a health study showing some toxic chemicals endanger humans at far lower levels than the EPA previously characterized as safe. One such chemical was present in high quantities around several military bases, including groundwater. The non-disclosure of the study and the delay in public knowledge of the findings may have prevented the government from updating the infrastructure at the bases and individuals who lived near the bases to avoid the tap water.The administration weakened enforcement the Endangered Species Act, making it easier to start mining, drilling and construction projects in areas with endangered and threatened species. The administration has actively discouraged local governments and businesses from undertaking preservation efforts.The administration sharply reduced the size of two national monuments in Utah by approximately two million acres, making it the largest reduction of public land protections in American history. Shortly afterwards, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke advocated for downsizing four additional national monuments and changing the way six additional monuments were managed. In 2019, the administration sped up the process for environmental reviews for oil and gas drilling in the Arctic; experts said the speeding up made reviews less comprehensive and reliable. According to Politico, the administration sped up the process in the event that a Democratic administration was elected in 2020, which would have halted new oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The administration sought to open up more than 180,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the largest in the country, for logging.In April 2018, Pruitt announced a policy change prohibiting EPA regulators from considering scientific research unless the raw data of the research was made publicly available. This would limit EPA regulators' use of much environmental research, given that participants in many such studies provide personal health information which is kept confidential. The EPA cited two bipartisan reports and various nonpartisan studies about the use of science in government to defend the decision. However, the authors of those reports dismissed that the EPA followed their instructions, with one author saying, \"They don't adopt any of our recommendations, and they go in a direction that's opposite, completely different. They don't adopt any of the recommendations of any of the sources they cite.\"In July 2020, <b>Trump</b> moved to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act by limiting public review to speed up permitting. In August 2020, <b>Trump</b> signed the Great American Outdoors Act to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. He had intended to oppose the bill and gut the fund until Republican senators afraid of losing their reelection bids and the Senate majority changed his mind. === Government size and regulations === The administration imposed far fewer financial penalties against banks and major companies accused of wrong-doing relative to the Obama administration.In the first six weeks of his tenure, <b>Trump</b> suspended \u2013 or in a few cases, revoked \u2013 more than 90 regulations. In early 2017, <b>Trump</b> signed an executive order directing federal agencies to slash two existing regulations for every new one (without spending on regulations going up). A September 2017 Bloomberg BNA review found that due to unclear wording in the order and the large proportion of regulations it exempts, the order had had little effect since it was signed. The <b>Trump</b> OMB released an analysis in February 2018 indicating the economic benefits of regulations significantly outweigh the economic costs. The administration ordered one-third of government advisory committees for federal agencies eliminated, except for committees that evaluate consumer product safety or committees that approve research grants.Trump ordered a four-month government-wide hiring freeze of the civilian work force (excluding staff in the military, national security, public safety and offices of new presidential appointees) at the start of his term. He said he did not intend to fill many of the governmental positions that were still vacant, as he considered them unnecessary; there were nearly 2,000 vacant government positions.The administration ended the requirement that nonprofits, including political advocacy groups who collect so-called dark money, disclose the names of large donors to the IRS; the Senate voted to overturn the administration's rule change. === Guns === The administration banned bump stocks after such devices were used by the gunman who perpetrated the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. In the wake of several mass shootings during the <b>Trump</b> administration, including August 2019 shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, <b>Trump</b> called on states to implement red flag laws to remove guns from \"those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety\". By November 2019, he abandoned the idea of red-flag laws. <b>Trump</b> repealed a regulation that barred gun ownership from approximately 75,000 individuals who received Social Security checks due to mental illness and who were deemed unfit to handle their financial affairs. The administration ended U.S. involvement in the UN Arms Trade Treaty to curb the international trade of conventional arms with countries having poor human rights records. === Health care === The 2010 Affordable Care Act (also known as \"Obamacare\" or the ACA) elicited major opposition from the Republican Party from its inception, and <b>Trump</b> called for a repeal of the law during the 2016 election campaign. On taking office, <b>Trump</b> promised to pass a healthcare bill that would cover everyone and result in better and less expensive insurance. Throughout his presidency, <b>Trump</b> repeatedly asserted that his administration and Republicans in Congress supported protections for individuals with preexisting conditions; however, fact-checkers noted the administration supported attempts both in Congress and in the courts to roll back the ACA (and its protections for preexisting conditions).Congressional Republicans made two serious efforts to repeal the ACA. First, in March 2017, <b>Trump</b> endorsed the American Health Care Act (AHCA), a Republican bill to repeal and replace the ACA. Opposition from several House Republicans, both moderate and conservative, led to the defeat of this version of the bill. Second in May 2017, the House narrowly voted in favor of a new version of the AHCA to repeal the ACA, sending the bill to the Senate for deliberation. Over the next weeks the Senate made several attempts to create a repeal bill; however, all the proposals were ultimately rejected in a series of Senate votes in late July. The individual mandate was repealed in December 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in May 2018 that repealing the individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured by eight million and that individual healthcare insurance premiums had increased by ten percent between 2017 and 2018. The administration later sided with a lawsuit to overturn the ACA, including protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions.Trump repeatedly expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\", and the <b>Trump</b> administration undermined Obamacare through various actions. The open enrollment period was cut from twelve weeks to six, the advertising budget for enrollment was cut by 90%, and organizations helping people shop for coverage got 39% less money. The CBO found that ACA enrollment at health care exchanges would be lower than its previous forecasts due to the <b>Trump</b> administration's undermining of the ACA. A 2019 study found that enrollment into the ACA during the <b>Trump</b> administration's first year was nearly thirty percent lower than during 2016. The CBO found that insurance premiums would rise sharply in 2018 due to the <b>Trump</b> administration's refusal to commit to continuing paying ACA subsidies, which added uncertainty to the insurance market and led insurers to raise premiums for fear they will not get subsidized.The administration ended subsidy payments to health insurance companies, in a move expected to raise premiums in 2018 for middle-class families by an average of about twenty percent nationwide and cost the federal government nearly $200 billion more than it saved over a ten-year period. The administration made it easier for businesses to use health insurance plans not covered by several of the ACA's protections, including for preexisting conditions, and allowed organizations not to cover birth control. In justifying the action, the administration made false claims about the health harms of contraceptives.The administration proposed substantial spending cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security Disability Insurance. <b>Trump</b> had previously vowed to protect Medicare and Medicaid. The administration reduced enforcement of penalties against nursing homes that harm residents. As a candidate and throughout his presidency, <b>Trump</b> said he would cut the costs of pharmaceuticals. During his first seven months in office, there were 96 price hikes for every drug price cut. Abandoning a promise he made as candidate, <b>Trump</b> announced he would not allow Medicare to use its bargaining power to negotiate lower drug prices. ==== Reproductive rights ==== <b>Trump</b> reinstated the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, prohibiting funding to foreign non-governmental organizations that perform abortions as a method of family planning in other countries. The administration implemented a policy restricting taxpayer dollars given to family planning facilities that mention abortion to patients, provide abortion referrals, or share space with abortion providers. As a result, Planned Parenthood, which provides Title X birth control services to 1.5 million women, withdrew from the program. Throughout his presidency, <b>Trump</b> pressed for a ban on late-term abortions and made frequent false claims about them.In 2018, the administration prohibited scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from acquiring new fetal tissue for research, and a year later stopped all medical research by government scientists that used fetal tissue.The administration geared HHS funding towards abstinence education programs for teens rather than the comprehensive sexual education programs the Obama administration funded.Trump's Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. <b>Trump</b> took credit for the decision, which threw abortion rights back to the states. ==== Opioid epidemic ==== <b>Trump</b> nominated Tom Marino to become the nation's drug czar but the nomination was withdrawn after an investigation found he had been the chief architect of a bill that crippled the enforcement powers of the Drug Enforcement Administration and worsened the opioid crisis.Kellyanne Conway led White House efforts to combat the opioid epidemic; Conway had no experience or expertise on matters of public health, substance abuse, or law enforcement. Conway sidelined drug experts and opted instead for the use of political staff. Politico wrote in 2018 that the administration's \"main response\" to the opioid crisis \"so far has been to call for a border wall and to promise a 'just say no' campaign\".In October 2017, the administration declared a 90-day public health emergency over the opioid epidemic and pledged to urgently mobilize the federal government in response to the crisis. On January 11, 2018, twelve days before the declaration ran out, Politico noted that \"beyond drawing more attention to the crisis, virtually nothing of consequence has been done.\" The administration had not proposed any new resources or spending, had not started the promised advertising campaign to spread awareness about addiction, and had yet to fill key public health and drug positions in the administration. One of the top officials at the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is tasked with multi-billion-dollar anti-drug initiatives and curbing the opioid epidemic, was a 24-year old campaign staffer from the <b>Trump</b> 2016 campaign who lied on his CV and whose stepfather went to jail for manufacturing illegal drugs; after the administration was contacted about the official's qualifications and CV, the administration gave him a job with different tasks. ==== COVID-19 pandemic ==== In 2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the <b>Trump</b> administration reorganized the Global Health Security and Biodefense unit at the NSC by merging it with other related units. Two months prior to the outbreak in Wuhan China, the <b>Trump</b> Administration had cut nearly $200 million in funding to Chinese research scientists studying animal coronaviruses. Throughout his presidency he also proposed budget cuts to global health. The <b>Trump</b> administration ignored detailed plans on how to mass-produce protective respirator masks under a program that had been launched by the Obama administration to alleviate a mask shortage for a future pandemic.From January to mid-March 2020, <b>Trump</b> consistently downplayed the threat posed by COVID-19 to the United States, giving many optimistic public statements. He accused Democrats and media outlets of exaggerating the seriousness of the situation, describing Democrats' criticism of his administration's response as a \"hoax\". By March 2020, however, <b>Trump</b> had adopted a more somber tone on the matter, acknowledging for the first time that COVID-19 was \"not under control\". Although the CDC recommended people wear face masks in public when social distancing is not possible, <b>Trump</b> continually refused to wear one. He praised and encouraged protesters who violated stay-at-home orders in Democratic states, as well as praised Republican governors who violated the White House's own COVID-19 guidelines regarding re-opening their economies.The White House Coronavirus Task Force was led by Vice President Mike Pence, Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah Birx, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Congress appropriated $8.3 billion in emergency funding, which <b>Trump</b> signed into law on March 6. During his oval office address on March 11, <b>Trump</b> announced an imminent travel ban between Europe and the U.S. The announcement caused chaos in European and American airports, as Americans abroad scrambled to get flights back to the U.S. The administration later had to clarify that the travel ban applied to foreigners coming from the Schengen Area, and later added Ireland and the UK to the list. Previously, in late January 2020, the administration banned travel to the U.S. from China; prior to the decision, major U.S. carriers had already announced that they would no longer fly to and from China. On March 13, <b>Trump</b> designated COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency, as the number of known cases of COVID-19 in the country exceeded 1,500, while known deaths exceeded 40.Although the U.S. government was initially quick to develop a diagnostic test for COVID-19, U.S. COVID-19 testing efforts from mid-January to late-February lost pace compared to the rest of the world. ABC News described the testing as \"shockingly slow\". When the WHO distributed 1.4 million COVID-19 tests in February, the U.S. chose instead to use its own tests. At that time, the CDC had produced 160,000 COVID-19 tests, but many were defective. As a result, fewer than 4,000 tests were done in the U.S. by February 27, with U.S. state laboratories conducting only about 200. In this period, academic laboratories and hospitals had developed their own tests, but were not allowed to use them until February 29, when the Food and Drug Administration issued approvals for them and private companies. A comprehensive New York Times investigation concluded that \"technical flaws, regulatory hurdles, business-as-usual bureaucracies and lack of leadership at multiple levels\" contributed to the testing failures. An Associated Press investigation found the administration made its first bulk orders for vital health care equipment, such as N95 respirator masks and ventilators, in mid-March. On March 26, the U.S. became the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, with over 82,000 cases. On April 11, the U.S. became the country with the highest official death toll for COVID-19, with over 20,000 deaths. The HHS Inspector General released a report in April of its survey of 323 hospitals in late March; reporting severe shortages of test supplies and extended waits for results, widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results. <b>Trump</b> called the IG's report \"just wrong\", and subsequently <b>Trump</b> replaced the Inspector General.Following a dramatic economic downturn as a result of the Covid-19 Pandemic, federal intervention in providing Governmental aid was heavily lobbied for resulting in the initial signing of a $8 Billion aid package relating to vaccine research and outbreak prevention among states in March 8th 2020 and a secondary $192 Billion aid package addressing sick leave for workers, expanding unemployment benefits and increased testing resources. A subsequent $2.2 Trillion aid package was later proposed and signed into law March 27th 2020 titled the CARES Act which provided forgivable loans for small buisnesses, increased unemployment benefits, a temporary child tax credit and further aid towards state and local governments in addressing the pandemic. The CARES Act emerged as the largest economic stimulus bill in American history with limited opposition against it; passing unanimously in the Senate and 419-6 in the House. An additional $900 Billion would be further dedicated to the pandemic in the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act that was signed into law December 27th 2020 despite initial opposition by <b>Trump</b> following criticism of the individual stimulus payments as too low and of the bill as having wasteful spending.In May 2020, five months into the pandemic, <b>Trump</b> announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the WHO. In July 2020, Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, formally notified the UN of U.S. decision to withdraw from the WHO, to take effect on July 6, 2021. Biden reversed Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO on January 20, 2021, on his first day in office.In June 2020, amid surges in COVID-19 case numbers, <b>Trump</b> administration officials falsely claimed that the steep rise was due to increased testing; public health experts disputed the administration's claims, noting that the positivity rate of tests was increasing.In October 2020, after a superspreader event at the White House, <b>Trump</b> announced that he and Melania <b>Trump</b> had tested positive for COVID-19 and would begin quarantining at the White House. Despite having the virus, <b>Trump</b> did not self-isolate and did not abstain from unnecessary risky behaviors. <b>Trump</b> was criticized for leaving his hospital room at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to go on a joyride to greet his supporters, thus exposing United States Secret Service agents to the disease.According to sources in the Biden administration, the <b>Trump</b> administration left no plan for vaccine distribution to the Biden administration, however, Anthony Fauci rejected this, stating that they were \"certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,\" and that the new administration was improving upon existing distribution efforts. In the last quarter of 2020, <b>Trump</b> administration officials lobbied Congress not to provide extra funding to states for vaccine rollout, thus hindering the vaccination rollout. One of those officials, Paul Mango, the deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, claimed that states didn't need extra money because they hadn't spent all the previously allocated money for vaccines given by the CDC. === Housing and urban policy === In December 2017, The Economist described the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), led by Carson, as \"directionless\". Most of the top HUD positions were unfilled and Carson's leadership was \"inconspicuous and inscrutable\". Of the policies HUD was enacting, The Economist wrote, \"it is hard not to conclude that the governing principle at HUD is to take whatever the Obama administration was doing, and do the opposite.\" HUD scaled back the enforcement of fair housing laws, halted several fair housing investigations started by the Obama administration and removed the words \"inclusive\" and \"free from discrimination\" from its mission statement. The administration designated Lynne Patton, an event planner who had worked on the <b>Trump</b> campaign and planned Eric Trump's wedding, to lead HUD's New York and New Jersey office (which oversees billions of federal dollars). === Immigration === <b>Trump</b> has repeatedly characterized illegal immigrants as criminals, although some studies have found they have lower crime and incarceration rates than native-born Americans. Prior to taking office, <b>Trump</b> promised to deport the estimated eleven million illegal immigrants living in the United States and to build a wall along the Mexico\u2013U.S. border. During his presidency, <b>Trump</b> reduced legal immigration substantially while the illegal immigrant population remained the same. The administration took several steps to limit the rights of legal immigrants, which included attempted revocations of Temporary Protected Status for Central American refugees, 60,000 Haitians (who emigrated following the 2010 Haiti earthquake), and 200,000 Salvadorans (who emigrated following a series of devastating earthquakes in 2001) as well as making it illegal for refugees and asylum seekers, and spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the U.S. A federal judge blocked the administration's attempt to deport the TPS recipients, citing what the judge said was Trump's racial \"animus against non-white, non-European immigrants\". The administration slashed refugee admissions to record low levels (since the modern program began in 1980). The administration made it harder non-citizens who served in the military to receive necessary paperwork to pursue U.S. citizenship. The administration's key legislative proposal on immigration was the 2017 RAISE Act, a proposal to reduce legal immigration levels to the U.S. by fifty percent by halving the number of green cards issued, capping refugee admissions at 50,000 a year and ending the visa diversity lottery. In 2020, the <b>Trump</b> administration set the lowest cap for refugees in the modern history of the United States for the subsequent year: 15,000 refugees. The administration increased fees for citizen applications, as well as caused delays in the processing of citizen applications.By February 2018, arrests of undocumented immigrants by ICE increased by forty percent during Trump's tenure. Arrests of noncriminal undocumented immigrants were twice as high as during Obama's final year in office. Arrests of undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions increased only slightly. In 2018, experts noted that the <b>Trump</b> administration's immigration policies had led to an increase in criminality and lawlessness along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, as asylum seekers prevented by U.S. authorities from filing for asylum had been preyed upon by human smugglers, organized crime and corrupt local law enforcement. To defend administration policies on immigration, the administration fudged data and presented intentionally misleading analyses of the costs associated with refugees (omitting data that showed net positive fiscal effects), as well as created the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement to highlight crimes committed by undocumented immigrants (there is no evidence undocumented immigrants increase the U.S. crime rate). In January 2018, <b>Trump</b> was widely criticized after referring to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations in general as \"shithole countries\" at a bipartisan meeting on immigration. Multiple international leaders condemned his remarks as racist.Upon taking office, <b>Trump</b> directed the DHS to begin work on a wall. An internal DHS report estimated Trump's wall would cost $21.6 billion and take 3.5 years to build (far higher than the <b>Trump</b> 2016 campaign's estimate ($12 billion) and the $15 billion estimate from Republican congressional leaders). In a January 2017 phone call between <b>Trump</b> and Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, <b>Trump</b> conceded that the U.S. would pay for the border wall, not Mexico as he promised during the campaign, and implored Nieto to stop saying publicly the Mexican government would not pay for the border wall. In January 2018, the administration proposed spending $18 billion over the next ten years on the wall, more than half of the $33 billion spending blueprint for border security. Trump's plan would reduce funding for border surveillance, radar technology, patrol boats and customs agents; experts and officials say these are more effective at curbing illegal immigration and preventing terrorism and smuggling than a border wall.The administration sought to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, which experts warned would likely result in severe undercounting of the population and faulty data, with naturalized U.S. citizens, legal immigrants, and undocumented immigrants all being less likely to respond to the census. Blue states were estimated to get fewer congressional seats and lower congressional appropriations than they would otherwise get, because they have larger non-citizen populations. Thomas B. Hofeller, an architect of Republican gerrymandering, had found adding the census question would help to gerrymander maps that \"would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites\" and that Hofeller had later written the key portion of a letter from the <b>Trump</b> administration's Justice Department justifying the addition of a citizenship question by claiming it was needed to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In July 2019, the Supreme Court in Department of Commerce v. New York blocked the administration from including the citizenship question on the census form.During the 2018 mid-term election campaign, <b>Trump</b> sent nearly 5,600 troops to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border for the stated purpose of protecting the United States against a caravan of Central American migrants. The Pentagon had previously concluded the caravan posed no threat to the U.S. The border deployment was estimated to cost as much as $220 million by the end of the year. With daily warnings from <b>Trump</b> about the dangers of the caravan during the mid-term election campaign, the frequency and intensity of the caravan rhetoric nearly stopped after election day. ==== Family separation policy ==== In May 2018, the administration announced it would separate children from parents caught unlawfully crossing the southern border into the United States. Parents were routinely charged with a misdemeanor and jailed; their children were placed in separate detention centers with no established procedure to track them or reunite them with their parent after they had served time for their offence, generally only a few hours or days. Later that month, <b>Trump</b> falsely accused Democrats of creating that policy, despite it originating from his own administration, and urged Congress to \"get together\" and pass an immigration bill. Members of Congress from both parties condemned the practice and pointed out that the White House could end the separations on its own. The Washington Post quoted a White House official as saying Trump's decision to separate migrant families was to gain political leverage to force Democrats and moderate Republicans to accept hardline immigration legislation.Six weeks into the implementation of the \"zero tolerance\" policy, at least 2,300 migrant children had been separated from their families. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the American Psychiatric Association condemned the policy, with the American Academy of Pediatrics saying the policy was causing \"irreparable harm\" to the children. The policy was extremely unpopular, more so than any major piece of legislation in recent memory. Videos and images of children held in cage-like detention centers, distraught parents separated from their children, and sobbing children caused an outcry. After criticism, DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen falsely claimed that \"We do not have a policy of separating families at the border.\"On June 20, 2018, amid worldwide outrage and enormous political pressure to roll back his policy, <b>Trump</b> reversed the family-separation policy by signing an executive order, despite earlier having said \"you can't do it through an executive order.\" Six days later, as the result of a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the family-separation policy, and required the government to reunite separated families within 30 days. By November 2020, the parents of 666 children still had not been found. The administration refused to provide funds to cover the expenses of reuniting families, and volunteer organizations continue to provide both volunteers and funding. The administration also refused to pay for mental health services for the families and orphaned children traumatized by the separations. ==== Travel bans ==== In January 2017, <b>Trump</b> signed an executive order which indefinitely suspended admission of asylum seekers fleeing the Syrian Civil War, suspended admission of all other refugees for 120 days, and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. The order also established a religious test for refugees from Muslim nations by giving priority to refugees of other religions over Muslim refugees. Later, the administration seemed to reverse a portion of part of the order, effectively exempting visitors with a green card. After the order was challenged in the federal courts, several federal judges issued rulings enjoining the government from enforcing the order. <b>Trump</b> fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she said she would not defend the order in court; Yates was replaced by Dana Boente, who said the Department of Justice would defend the order.A new executive order was signed in March which limited travel to the U.S. from six different countries for 90 days, and by all refugees who do not possess either a visa or valid travel documents for 120 days. The new executive order revoked and replaced the executive order issued in January.In June, the Supreme Court partially stayed certain injunctions that were put on the order by two federal appeals courts earlier, allowing the executive order to mostly go into effect. In October, the Court dismissed the case, saying the orders had been replaced by a new proclamation, so challenges to the previous executive orders are moot.In September, <b>Trump</b> signed a proclamation placing limits on the six countries in the second executive order and added Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela. In October 2017, Judge Derrick Watson, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii issued another temporary restraining order. In December 2017, the Supreme Court allowed the September 2017 travel restrictions to go into effect while legal challenges in Hawaii and Maryland are heard. The decision effectively barred most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea from entry into the United States along with some government officials from Venezuela and their families.In January 2020, <b>Trump</b> added Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Sudan, and Tanzania to the visa ban list.Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, <b>Trump</b> further restricted travel from Iran on February 29, 2020, and advised American citizens not to travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea in response to COVID-19. In March 2020, the <b>Trump</b> administration later issued a ban on entrants from all Schengen Area countries, eventually including Ireland and the UK. ==== 2018\u20132019 federal government shutdown ==== The federal government was partially shut down from December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, (the longest shutdown in U.S. history) over Trump's demand that Congress provide $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall. The House and Senate lacked votes necessary to support his funding demand and to overcome Trump's refusal to sign the appropriations last passed by Congress into law. In negotiations with Democratic leaders leading up to the shutdown, <b>Trump</b> commented he would be \"proud to shut down the government for border security\". By mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.In September 2020, Brian Murphy \u2013 who until August 2020 was the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis \u2013 asserted in a whistleblower complaint that during the shutdown senior DHS officials sought to inflate the number of known or suspected terrorists who had been apprehended at the border, to increase support for funding the wall. NBC News reported that in early 2019 a DHS spokeswoman, Katie Waldman, pushed the network to retract a story that correctly cited only six such apprehensions in the first half of 2018, compared to the nearly four thousand a year the administration was publicly claiming. The story was not retracted, and Waldman later became the press secretary for Vice President Pence and wife of <b>Trump</b> advisor Stephen Miller. === LGBT rights === The administration rolled back numerous LGBT protections, in particular those implemented during the Obama administration, covering issues such as health care, education, employment, housing, military, and criminal justice, as well as foster care and adoption. The administration rescinded rules prohibiting taxpayer-funded adoption and foster care agencies from discriminating against LGBT adoption and foster parents. The Department of Justice reversed its position on whether the Civil Rights Act's workplace protections covered LGBT individuals and argued in state and federal courts for a constitutional right for businesses to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The administration exempted government contractors from following federal workplace discrimination rules, as long as they could cite religious reasons for doing so.The administration rescinded a directive that public schools treat students according to their gender identity. The administration rescinded a federal policy that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity, and dropped a lawsuit against North Carolina's \"bathroom bill\". The administration rescinded rules that prohibited discrimination against LGBT patients by health care providers. Rules were rescinded to give transgender homeless people equal access to homeless shelters, and to house transgender prison inmates according to their gender identity \"when appropriate\". HHS stopped collecting information on LGBT participants in its national survey of older adults, and the Census Bureau removed \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" as proposed subjects for possible inclusion on the decennial census and/or American Community Survey. The Justice Department and Labor Department cancelled quarterly conference calls with LGBT organizations.Trump said he would not allow \"transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military\", citing disruptions and medical costs. In March 2018, he signed a Presidential Memorandum to prohibit transgender persons, whether transitioned or not, with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria from military service, except for individuals who have had 36 consecutive months of stability \"in their biological sex before accession\" and currently serving transgender persons in military service. Studies have found that allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military has \"little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness\" and that medical costs associated with transgender service members would be \"minimal\".In 2017, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov and a Chechen law enforcement official, citing anti-gay purges in Chechnya. In February 2019, the administration launched a global campaign to end the criminalization of homosexuality; the initiative was pushed by Richard Grenell, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany. Asked about the administration's campaign, <b>Trump</b> appeared to be unaware of it. In February 2020, <b>Trump</b> appointed Grenell acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI), marking the first time in history an openly gay official served in a Cabinet Level position. === George Floyd protests === In response to the 2020 rioting and looting amid nationwide protests against racism and police brutality after a white Minneapolis Police Department officer murdered an African American man named George Floyd, <b>Trump</b> tweeted a quote, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\", coined in 1967 by a Miami police chief that has been widely condemned by civil rights groups. <b>Trump</b> later addressed protestors outside the White House by saying they \"would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen\" if they breached the White House fence. ==== Photo-op at St. John's Episcopal Church ==== On June 1, 2020, hundreds of police officers, members of the National Guard and other forces, in riot gear used smoke canisters, rubber bullets, batons and shields to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters outside St. John's Episcopal Church across Lafayette Square from the White House. A news crew from Australia was attacked by these forces and clergy on the church's porch suffered effects of the gas and were dispersed along with the others. Trump, accompanied by other officials including the Secretary of Defense, then walked across Lafayette Square and posed for pictures while he was holding a Bible up for the cameras, outside the church which had suffered minor damage from a fire started by arsonists the night before. Mariann Edgar Budde, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington said she was \"outraged\" by Trump's actions, which also received widespread condemnation from other religious leaders. However, the reaction from the religious right and evangelicals generally praised the visit. ==== Deployment of federal law enforcement to cities ==== In July 2020, federal forces were deployed to Portland, Oregon, in response to rioting during protests against police brutality, which had resulted in vandalism to the city's federal courthouse. The Department of Homeland Security cited Trump's June 26 executive order to protect statues and monuments as allowing federal officers to be deployed without the permission of individual states. Federal agents fired pepper spray or tear gas at protesters who got too close to the U.S. courthouse. The heavily armed officers were dressed in military camouflage uniforms (without identification) and used unmarked vans to arrest protestors, some of whom were nowhere near the federal courthouse.The presence and tactics of the officers drew widespread condemnation. Oregon officials including the governor, the mayor of Portland, and multiple members of Congress asked the DHS to remove federal agents from the city. The mayor said the officers were causing violence and \"we do not need or want their help.\" Multiple Congressional committees asked for an investigation, saying \"Citizens are concerned that the Administration has deployed a secret police force.\" Lawsuits against the administration were filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Attorney General of Oregon. The inspectors general for the Justice Department and Homeland Security announced investigations into the deployment.Trump said he was pleased with the way things were going in Portland and said that he might send federal law enforcement to many more cities, including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, and Oakland \u2013 \"all run by liberal Democrats\". Albuquerque and Milwaukee were also named as potential targets.Under a deal worked out between Governor Kate Brown and the <b>Trump</b> administration, federal agents withdrew to standby locations on July 30, while state and local law enforcement forces took over responsibility for protecting the courthouse; they made no arrests and mostly stayed out of sight. Protests that night were peaceful. A DHS spokesperson said federal officers would remain in the area at least until the following Monday. === Science === The administration marginalized the role of science in policymaking, halted numerous research projects, and saw the departure of scientists who said their work was marginalized or suppressed. In 2018, 19 months after <b>Trump</b> took office, meteorologist Kelvin Droegemeier became the Science Advisor to the President; this was the longest period without a science advisor since the 1976 administration. While preparing for talks with Kim Jong-un, the White House did not do so with the assistance of a White House science adviser or senior counselor trained in nuclear physics. The position of chief scientist in the State Department or the Department of Agriculture was not filled. The administration nominated Sam Clovis to be chief scientist in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but he had no scientific background and the White House later withdrew the nomination. The administration successfully nominated Jim Bridenstine, who had no background in science and rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, to lead NASA. The U.S. Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) disbanded advisory committees, while the Department of Energy prohibited use of the term \"climate change\". In March 2020, The New York Times reported that an official at the Interior Department has repeatedly inserted climate change-denying language into the agency's scientific reports, such as those that affect water and mineral rights.During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the <b>Trump</b> administration replaced career public affairs staff at the Department of Health and Human Services with political appointees, including Michael Caputo, who interfered with weekly Centers for Disease Control scientific reports and attempted to silence the government's most senior infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, \"sowing distrust of the FDA at a time when health leaders desperately need people to accept a vaccine in order to create the immunity necessary to defeat the novel coronavirus\". One day after <b>Trump</b> noted that he might dismiss an FDA proposal to improve standards for emergency use of a COVID-19 vaccine, the presidents of the National Academies of Sciences and Medicine issued a statement expressing alarm at political interference in science during a pandemic, \"particularly the overriding of evidence and advice from public health officials and derision of government scientists\". === Space === NASA began the Artemis program in December 2017, with its initial focus on returning humans to the Moon for commercial mining and research, aiming to secure the leading position in the emerging commercial space race. <b>Trump</b> also promoted the United States Space Force. On December 20, 2019, the Space Force Act, developed by Democratic Representative Jim Cooper and Republican Representative Mike Rogers, was signed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The act reorganized the Air Force Space Command into the United States Space Force, and created the first new independent military service since the Army Air Forces were reorganized as the U.S. Air Force in 1947. === Surveillance === In 2019, <b>Trump</b> signed into law a six-year extension of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, allowing the NSA to conduct searches of foreigners' communications without any warrant. The process incidentally collects information from Americans. === Veterans affairs === Prior to David Shulkin's firing in April 2018, The New York Times described the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as a \"rare spot of calm in the <b>Trump</b> administration\". Shulkin built upon changes started under the Obama administration to do a long-term overhaul of the VA system. In May 2018, legislation to increase veterans' access to private care was stalled, as was a VA overhaul which sought to synchronize medical records. In May 2018, there were reports of a large number of resignations of senior staffers and a major re-shuffling.In August 2018, ProPublica reported that three wealthy patrons of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, formed an \"informal council\" that strongly influenced VA policy, including reviewing a confidential $10 billion contract to modernize the VA's records. The Government Accountability Office announced in November 2018 that it would investigate the matter.In 2018, <b>Trump</b> signed into law the VA MISSION Act, which expanded eligibility for the Veterans Choice program, allowing veterans greater access to private sector healthcare. <b>Trump</b> falsely asserted more than 150 times that he created the Veterans Choice program, which has in fact existed since being signed into law by president Obama in 2014. === Voting rights === Under the <b>Trump</b> administration, the Justice Department limited enforcement actions to protect voting rights, and in fact often defended restrictions on voting rights imposed by various states that have been challenged as voter suppression. The Justice Department under <b>Trump</b> has filed only a single new case under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Trump's Justice Department opposed minority voters' interests in all of the major voting litigation since 2017 in which the Justice Department Civil Rights Division Voting Section has been involved.Trump has repeatedly alleged, without evidence, there was widespread voter fraud. The administration created a commission with the stated purpose to review the extent of voter fraud in the wake of Trump's false claim that millions of unauthorized votes cost him the popular vote in the 2016 election. It was chaired by Vice President Pence, while the day-to-day administrator was Kris Kobach, best known for promoting restrictions on access to voting. The commission began its work by requesting each state to turn over detailed information about all registered voters in their database. Most states rejected the request, citing privacy concerns or state laws. Multiple lawsuits were filed against the commission. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said Kobach was refusing to share working documents and scheduling information with him and the other Democrats on the commission. A federal judge ordered the commission to hand over the documents. Shortly thereafter, <b>Trump</b> disbanded the commission, and informed Dunlap that it would not obey the court order to provide the documents because the commission no longer existed. Election integrity experts argued that the commission was disbanded because of the lawsuits, which would have led to greater transparency and accountability and thus prevented the Republican members of the commission from producing a sham report to justify restrictions on voting rights. It was later revealed the commission had, in its requests for Texas voter data, specifically asked for data that identifies voters with Hispanic surnames. === White nationalists and Charlottesville rally === On August 13, 2017, <b>Trump</b> condemned violence \"on many sides\" after a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, the previous day (August 12) turned deadly. A white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. According to Sessions, that action met the definition of domestic terrorism. During the rally there had been other violence, as some counter-protesters charged at the white nationalists with swinging clubs and mace, throwing bottles, rocks, and paint. <b>Trump</b> did not expressly mention neo-Nazis, white supremacists, or the alt-right movement in his remarks on August 13, but the following day condemned \"the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups\". On August 15, he again blamed \"both sides\".Many Republican and Democratic elected officials condemned the violence and hatred of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists. <b>Trump</b> came under criticism from world leaders and politicians, as well as a variety of religious groups and anti-hate organizations for his remarks, which were seen as muted and equivocal. The New York Times reported <b>Trump</b> \"was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides'\", and said <b>Trump</b> had \"buoyed the white nationalist movement on Tuesday as no president has done in generations\". == Foreign affairs == The foreign policy positions expressed by <b>Trump</b> during his presidential campaign changed frequently, so it was \"difficult to glean a political agenda, or even a set of clear, core policy values ahead of his presidency\". Under a banner of \"America First\", the <b>Trump</b> administration distinguished itself from past administrations with frequent open admiration of authoritarian rulers and rhetorical rejections of key human rights norms.Despite pledges to reduce the number of active duty U.S. military personnel deployed overseas, the number was essentially the same three years into Trump's presidency as they were at the end of Obama's.In August 2019, <b>Trump</b> cancelled a state visit to Denmark by invitation of Queen Margrethe II due to Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen having called Trump's suggestion to buy Greenland, a territory within the Danish Realm, \"an absurd discussion\".On October 27, 2019, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself and three children by detonating a suicide vest during the Barisha raid conducted by the U.S. Delta Force in Syria's northwestern Idlib Province.Trump withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty, a nearly three-decade old agreement promoting transparency of military forces and activities. === Defense === As a candidate and as president, <b>Trump</b> called for a major build-up of American military capabilities. <b>Trump</b> announced in October 2018 that the United States would withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia. The goal was to enable the United States to counter increasing Chinese intermediate nuclear missile capabilities in the Pacific. In December 2018, <b>Trump</b> complained about the amount the United States spends on an \"uncontrollable arms race\" with Russia and China. <b>Trump</b> said that the $716 billion which the United States was spending on the \"arms race\" was \"Crazy!\". He had previously praised his own increased defense spending, five months earlier. The total fiscal 2019 defense budget authorization was $716 billion, although missile defense and nuclear programs made up about $10 billion of the total.During 2018, <b>Trump</b> falsely asserted that he had secured the largest defense budget authorization ever, the first military pay raise in ten years, and that military spending was at least 4.0% of GDP, \"which got a lot bigger since I became your president\".Controversy arose in November 2019 after <b>Trump</b> pardoned or promoted three soldiers accused or convicted of war crimes. The most prominent case involved Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL team chief who had been reported to Navy authorities by his own team members for sniping at an unarmed civilian girl and an elderly man. Gallagher faced court martial for the murder of a wounded teenage combatant, among other charges. The medic of his SEAL team was granted immunity to testify against him, but on the witness stand the medic reversed what he had previously told investigators and testified that he himself had murdered the teenage combatant. Gallagher was subsequently acquitted of the murder charge against him, and the Navy demoted him to the lowest possible rank due to his conviction on another charge. The Navy later moved to strip Gallagher of his Trident pin and to eject him from the Navy. <b>Trump</b> intervened to restore Gallagher's rank and pin. Many military officers were enraged by Trump's intervention, as they felt it disrupted principles of military discipline and justice. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer protested Trump's intervention and was forced to resign; in his resignation letter, he sharply rebuked <b>Trump</b> for his judgment in the matter. <b>Trump</b> told a rally audience days later, \"I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state.\"The <b>Trump</b> administration sharply increased the frequency of drone strikes compared to the preceding Obama administration, in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, rollbacked transparency in reporting drone strike deaths, and reduced accountability. In March 2019, <b>Trump</b> ended the Obama policy of reporting the number of civilian deaths caused by U.S. drone strikes, claiming that this policy was unnecessary. === Afghanistan === The number of U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan decreased significantly during Trump's presidency. By the end of Trump's term in office troop levels in Afghanistan were at the lowest levels since the early days of the war in 2001. Trump's presidency saw an expansion of drone warfare and a massive increase in civilian casualties from airstrikes in Afghanistan relative to the Obama administration.In February 2020, the <b>Trump</b> administration signed a deal with the Taliban, which if upheld by the Taliban, would result in the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan by May 2021 (Trump's successor Joe Biden later extended the deadline to September 2021). As part of the deal, the U.S. agreed to the release of 5,000 Taliban members who were imprisoned by the Afghan government; some of these ex-prisoners went on to join the 2021 Taliban offensive that felled the Afghan government.In 2020, US casualties in Afghanistan reached their lowest level for the entire war. In Iraq, casualties increased, being significantly higher in Trump's term than Obama's second term.Following the collapse of the Afghan government and the fall of Kabul in August 2021, accusations by Olivia Troye surfaced on Twitter of the <b>Trump</b> Administration deliberately obstructing the visa process for Afghans who had helped U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. === China === On January 19, 2021, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the Department of State had determined that \"genocide and crimes against humanity\" had been perpetrated by China against the Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The announcement was made on the last day of Trump's presidency. The incoming president, Joe Biden, had already declared during his presidential campaign, that such a determination should be made. On January 20, 2021, Pompeo along with other <b>Trump</b> administration officials were sanctioned by China. === Cuba === === North Korea === After initially adopting a verbally hostile posture toward North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong-un, <b>Trump</b> quickly pivoted to embrace the regime, saying he and Kim \"fell in love\". <b>Trump</b> engaged Kim by meeting him at two summits, in June 2018 and February 2019, an unprecedented move by an American president, as previous policy had been that a president's simply meeting with the North Korean leader would legitimize the regime on the world stage. During the June 2018 summit, the leaders signed a vague agreement to pursue denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, with <b>Trump</b> immediately declaring \"There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.\" Little progress was made toward that goal during the months before the February 2019 summit, which ended abruptly without an agreement, hours after the White House announced a signing ceremony was imminent. During the months between the summits, a growing body of evidence indicated North Korea was continuing its nuclear fuel, bomb and missile development, including by redeveloping an ICBM site it was previously appearing to dismantle \u2013 even while the second summit was underway. In the aftermath of the February 2019 failed summit, the Treasury department imposed additional sanctions on North Korea. The following day, <b>Trump</b> tweeted, \"It was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea. I have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!\" On December 31, 2019, the Korean Central News Agency announced that Kim had abandoned his moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, quoting Kim as saying, \"the world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future.\" Two years after the Singapore summit, the North Korean nuclear arsenal had significantly expanded.During a June 2019 visit to South Korea, <b>Trump</b> visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone and invited North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to meet him there, which he did, and <b>Trump</b> became the first sitting president to step inside North Korea. === Turkey === In October 2019, after <b>Trump</b> spoke to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the White House acknowledged that Turkey would be carrying out a planned military offensive into northern Syria; as such, U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area to avoid interference with that operation. The statement also passed responsibility for the area's captured ISIS fighters to Turkey. Congress members of both parties denounced the move, including Republican allies of <b>Trump</b> like Senator Lindsey Graham. They argued that the move betrayed the American-allied Kurds, and would benefit ISIS, Russia, Iran and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime. <b>Trump</b> defended the move, citing the high cost of supporting the Kurds, and the lack of support from the Kurds in past U.S. wars. Within a week of the U.S. pullout, Turkey proceeded to attack Kurdish-controlled areas in northeast Syria. Kurdish forces then announced an alliance with the Syrian government and its Russian allies, in a united effort to repel Turkey. === Iran === After an Iranian missile test on January 29, 2017, and Houthi attacks on Saudi warships, the <b>Trump</b> administration sanctioned 12 companies and 13 individuals suspected of being involved in Iran's missile program. In May 2018, <b>Trump</b> withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program. Analysts determined that, after the United States's withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.In January 2020, <b>Trump</b> ordered a U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who had planned nearly every significant operation by Iranian forces over the past two decades. <b>Trump</b> threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites, including some \"important to Iran & the Iranian culture\", if Iran retaliated. The threat to hit cultural sites was seen as illegal and both Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. would not attack such sites, but would \"follow the laws of armed conflict\" and \"behave inside the system\". Iran did retaliate with ballistic missile strikes against two U.S. airbases in Iraq. On the same day, amid the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, Iran accidentally shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 after takeoff from Tehran airport.In August 2020, the <b>Trump</b> administration unsuccessfully attempted to trigger a mechanism that was part of the agreement and would have led to the return of U.N. sanctions against Iran. The <b>Trump</b> administration asserted that the U.S. remained a \"participant\" in the Iran Deal to persuade the United Nations Security Council to reimpose pre-agreement sanctions on Iran for its breaches of the deal after the U.S. withdrawal. The agreement provided for a resolution process among signatories in the event of a breach, but that process had not yet played out. The Security Council voted on the administration's proposal in August, with only the Dominican Republic joining the U.S. to vote in favor. === Saudi Arabia === <b>Trump</b> actively supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis. <b>Trump</b> also praised his relationship with Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. On May 20, 2017, <b>Trump</b> and Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud signed a series of letters of intent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to purchase arms from the United States totaling $110 billion immediately, and $350 billion over ten years. The transfer was widely seen as a counterbalance against the influence of Iran in the region and a \"significant\" and \"historic\" expansion of United States relations with Saudi Arabia. By July 2019, two of Trump's three vetoes were to overturn bipartisan congressional action related to Saudi Arabia.In October 2018, amid widespread condemnation of Saudi Arabia for the murder of prominent Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, the <b>Trump</b> administration pushed back on the condemnation. After the CIA assessed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman ordered the murder of Khashoggi, <b>Trump</b> rejected the assessment and said the CIA only had \"feelings\" on the matter. === Israel / Palestine === Since the Six Day War in 1967, the United States had considered Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank to be \"illegitimate\". This status changed in November 2019 when the <b>Trump</b> administration shifted U.S. policy and declared \"the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not per se inconsistent with international law.\"Trump unveiled his own peace plan to resolve the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict on January 28, 2020. This was realized in August 2020 with the first of the Abraham Accords, when Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to begin normalizing relations in an agreement brokered by Jared Kushner, an accomplishment described by Foreign Policy as \"arguably his administration's first unqualified diplomatic success\". The following month, Israel and Bahrain agreed to normalize diplomatic relations in another deal mediated and brokered by the <b>Trump</b> administration. A month later, Israel and Sudan agreed to normalize relations in a third such agreement in as many months. On December 10, 2020, <b>Trump</b> announced that Israel and Morocco had agreed to establish full diplomatic relations, while also announcing that the United States recognized Morocco's claim over the disputed territory of Western Sahara. === United Arab Emirates === As Donald <b>Trump</b> lost the election bid against Joe Biden, the U.S. State Department notified Congress about its plans to sell 18 sophisticated armed MQ-9B aerial drones to the United Arab Emirates, under a deal worth $2.9 billion. The drones were expected to be equipped with maritime radar, and the delivery was being estimated by 2024. Besides, another informal notification was sent to the Congress regarding the plans of providing the UAE with $10 billion of defense equipment, including precision-guided munitions, non-precision bombs and missiles. == Russia and related investigations == American intelligence sources found the Russian government attempted to intervene in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump, and that members of Trump's campaign were in contact with Russian government officials both before and after the election. In May 2017, the Department of Justice appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate \"any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\".During his January 2017 confirmation hearings as the attorney general nominee before the Senate, then-Senator Jeff Sessions appeared to deliberately omit two meetings he had in 2016 with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, when asked if he had meetings involving the 2016 election with Russian government officials. Sessions later amended his testimony saying he \"never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign\". Following his amended statement, Sessions recused himself from any investigation regarding connections between <b>Trump</b> and Russia.In May 2017, <b>Trump</b> discussed highly classified intelligence in an Oval Office meeting with the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and ambassador Sergey Kislyak, providing details that could expose the source of the information and how it was collected. A Middle Eastern ally provided the intelligence which had the highest level of classification and was not intended to be shared widely. The New York Times reported, \"sharing the information without the express permission of the ally who provided it was a major breach of espionage etiquette, and could jeopardize a crucial intelligence-sharing relationship.\" The White House, through National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster, issued a limited denial, saying the story \"as reported\" was incorrect and that no \"intelligence sources or methods\" were discussed. McMaster did not deny that information had been disclosed. The following day <b>Trump</b> said on Twitter that Russia is an important ally against terrorism and that he had an \"absolute right\" to share classified information with Russia. Soon after the meeting, American intelligence extracted a high-level covert source from within the Russian government, on concerns the individual could be at risk due, in part, to <b>Trump</b> and his administration repeatedly mishandling classified intelligence.In October 2017, former <b>Trump</b> campaign advisor George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to the FBI regarding his contacts with Russian agents. During the campaign he had tried repeatedly but unsuccessfully to set up meetings in Russia between <b>Trump</b> campaign representatives and Russian officials.Trump went to great lengths to keep details of his private conversations with Russian president Putin secret, including in one case by retaining his interpreter's notes and instructing the linguist to not share the contents of the discussions with anyone in the administration. As a result, there were no detailed records, even in classified files, of Trump's conversations with Putin on five occasions.Of Trump's campaign advisors and staff, six of them were indicted by the special counsel's office; five of them (Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos) pleaded guilty, while one has pleaded not guilty (Roger Stone). As of December 2020, Stone, Papadopoulos, Manafort, and Flynn have been pardoned by Trump, but not Cohen or Gates.On June 12, 2019, <b>Trump</b> asserted he saw nothing wrong in accepting intelligence on his political adversaries from foreign powers, such as Russia, and he could see no reason to contact the FBI about it. Responding to a reporter who told him FBI director Christopher Wray had said such activities should be reported to the FBI, <b>Trump</b> said, \"the FBI director is wrong.\" <b>Trump</b> elaborated, \"there's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, 'we have information on your opponent' \u2013 oh, I think I'd want to hear it.\" Both Democrats and Republicans repudiated the remarks.The New York Times reported in June 2021 that in 2017 and 2018 the Justice Department subpoenaed metadata from the iCloud accounts of at least a dozen individuals associated with the House Intelligence Committee, including that of Democrat ranking member Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, and family members, to investigate leaks to the press about contacts between <b>Trump</b> associates and Russia. Records of the inquiry did not implicate anyone associated with the committee, but upon becoming attorney general Bill Barr revived the effort, including by appointing a federal prosecutor and about six others in February 2020. The Times reported that, apart from corruption investigations, subpoenaing communications information of members of Congress is nearly unheard-of, and that some in the Justice Department saw Barr's approach as politically motivated. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced an inquiry into the matter the day after the Times report. === Special counsel's report === In February 2018, when Mueller indicted more than a dozen Russians and three entities for interference in the 2016 election, <b>Trump</b> asserted the indictment was proof his campaign did not collude with the Russians. The New York Times noted <b>Trump</b> \"voiced no concern that a foreign power had been trying for nearly four years to upend American democracy, much less resolve to stop it from continuing to do so this year\".In July 2018, the special counsel indicted twelve Russian intelligence operatives and accused them of conspiring to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections, by hacking servers and emails of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign. The indictments were made before Trump's meeting with Putin in Helsinki, in which <b>Trump</b> supported Putin's denial that Russia was involved and criticized American law enforcement and intelligence community (subsequently <b>Trump</b> partially walked back some of his comments). A few days later, it was reported that <b>Trump</b> had actually been briefed on the veracity and extent of Russian cyber-attacks two weeks before his inauguration, back in December 2016, including the fact that these were ordered by Putin himself. The evidence presented to him at the time included text and email conversations between Russian military officers as well as information from a source close to Putin. On March 22, 2019, Mueller submitted the final report to Attorney General William Barr. Two days later, Barr sent Congress a four-page letter, describing what he said were the special counsel's principal conclusions in the report. Barr added that, since the special counsel \"did not draw a conclusion\" on obstruction, this \"leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime\". Barr continued: \"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\"On April 18, 2019, a two-volume redacted version of the special counsel's report titled Report on the Investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential Election was released to Congress and to the public. About one-eighth of the lines in the public version were redacted.Volume I discusses about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, concluding that interference occurred \"in sweeping and systematic fashion\" and \"violated U.S. criminal law\". The report detailed activities by the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-linked Russian troll farm, to create a \"social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. <b>Trump</b> and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\", and to \"provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States\". The report also described how the Russian intelligence service, the GRU, performed computer hacking and strategic releasing of damaging material from the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations. To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the <b>Trump</b> campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators used the legal standard for criminal conspiracy rather than the popular concept of \"collusion\", because a crime of \"collusion\" is not found in criminal law or the United States Code.According to the report, the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the <b>Trump</b> campaign\", and found that Russia had \"perceived it would benefit from a <b>Trump</b> presidency\" and the 2016 <b>Trump</b> presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, \"the investigation did not establish that members of the <b>Trump</b> campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\" However, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of the <b>Trump</b> campaign providing false or incomplete testimony, exercising the privilege against self-incrimination, and having deleted, unsaved, or encrypted communications. As such, the Mueller report \"cannot rule out the possibility\" that information then unavailable to investigators would have presented different findings.Volume II covered obstruction of justice. The report described ten episodes where <b>Trump</b> may have obstructed justice as president, plus one instance before he was elected. The report said that in addition to Trump's public attacks on the investigation and its subjects, he had also privately tried to \"control the investigation\" in multiple ways, but mostly failed to influence it because his subordinates or associates refused to carry out his instructions. For that reason, no charges against the Trump's aides and associates were recommended \"beyond those already filed\". The special counsel could not charge <b>Trump</b> himself once investigators decided to abide by an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion that a sitting president cannot stand trial, and they feared charges would affect Trump's governing and possibly preempt his impeachment. In addition, investigators felt it would be unfair to accuse <b>Trump</b> of a crime without charges and without a trial in which he could clear his name, hence investigators \"determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\".Since the special counsel's office had decided \"not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment\" on whether to \"initiate or decline a prosecution\", they \"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct\". The report \"does not conclude that the president committed a crime\", but specifically did not exonerate <b>Trump</b> on obstruction of justice, because investigators were not confident that <b>Trump</b> was innocent after examining his intent and actions. The report concluded \"that Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice\" and \"that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the president's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law\".On May 1, 2019, following publication of the special counsel's report, Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which Barr said he \"didn't exonerate\" <b>Trump</b> on obstruction as that was not the role of the Justice Department. He declined to testify before the House Judiciary Committee the following day because he objected to the committee's plan to use staff lawyers during questioning. Barr also repeatedly failed to give the unredacted special counsel's report to the Judiciary Committee by its deadline of May 6, 2019. On May 8, 2019, the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress, which refers the matter to entire House for resolution. Concurrently, <b>Trump</b> asserted executive privilege via the Department of Justice in an effort to prevent the redacted portions of the special counsel's report and the underlying evidence from being disclosed. Committee chairman Jerry Nadler said the U.S. is in a constitutional crisis, \"because the President is disobeying the law, is refusing all information to Congress\". Speaker Nancy Pelosi said <b>Trump</b> was \"self-impeaching\" by stonewalling Congress.Following release of the Mueller report, <b>Trump</b> and his allies turned their attention toward \"investigating the investigators\". On May 23, 2019, <b>Trump</b> ordered the intelligence community to cooperate with Barr's investigation of the origins of the investigation, granting Barr full authority to declassify any intelligence information related to the matter. Some analysts expressed concerns that the order could create a conflict between the Justice Department and the intelligence community over closely guarded intelligence sources and methods, as well as open the possibility Barr could cherrypick intelligence for public release to help Trump.Upon announcing the formal closure of the investigation and his resignation from the Justice Department on May 29, Mueller said, \"If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, decide as to whether the president did commit a crime.\" During his testimony to Congress on July 24, 2019, Mueller said that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after the president left office. === Counter-investigations === Amid accusations by <b>Trump</b> and his supporters that he had been subjected to an illegitimate investigation, in May 2019, Barr appointed federal prosecutor John Durham to review the origins of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. By September 2020, Durham's inquiry had expanded to include the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation during the 2016 campaign.In November 2017, Sessions appointed U.S. Attorney John Huber to investigate the FBI's surveillance of Carter Page and connections between the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One, starting in November 2017. The investigation ended in January 2020 after no evidence was found to warrant the opening of a criminal investigation. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's April 2019 report documented that <b>Trump</b> pressured Sessions and the Department of Justice to re-open the investigation into Clinton's emails. == Ethics == The <b>Trump</b> administration has been characterized by a departure from ethical norms. Unlike previous administrations of both parties, the <b>Trump</b> White House has not observed a strict boundary between official government activities and personal, political, or campaign activities. === Role of lobbyists === During the 2016 campaign, <b>Trump</b> promised to \"drain the swamp\" \u2013 a phrase that usually refers to entrenched corruption and lobbying in Washington, D.C. \u2013 and he proposed a series of ethics reforms. However, according to federal records and interviews, there has been a dramatic increase in lobbying by corporations and hired interests during Trump's tenure, particularly through Pence's office. About twice as many lobbying firms contacted Pence, compared to previous presidencies, among them representatives of major energy firms and drug companies. In many cases, the lobbyists have charged their clients millions of dollars for access to the vice president, and then have turned around and donated the money to Pence's political causes.Among the administration's first policies was a five-year ban on serving as a lobbyist after working in the executive branch. However, as one of his final acts of office, <b>Trump</b> rolled back that policy, thus allowing administration staff to work as lobbyists.A number of former <b>Trump</b> associates, fundraisers and aides had faced criminal charges. In July 2021, one of his high-profile associates and a close friend, Thomas J. Barrack Jr. was arrested on federal charges for acting as an unregistered foreign lobbyist, obstructing justice and giving false statements to the FBI. The 74-year-old private equity investor was accused in a nine-count indictment of illegally lobbying and exerting influence over <b>Trump</b> on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. Federal prosecutors said Barrack had to complete the \"wish list\" given by the Emirati officials, stating what foreign policy changes they expected from the US. A former top executive at Barrack's firm, Matthew Grimes, and an Emirati businessman, Rashid al-Malik, also faced federal charges of acting as Emirati agents without registering with the Justice Department. Barrack pleaded not guilty and was released from custody after posting $250 million bail with a cash security of $5 million. Barrack and Grimes were found not guilty on all charges in November 2022. === Potential conflicts of interest === Trump's presidency has been marked by significant public concern about conflict of interest stemming from his diverse business ventures. In the lead up to his inauguration, <b>Trump</b> promised to remove himself from the day-to-day operations of his businesses. <b>Trump</b> placed his sons Eric <b>Trump</b> and Donald <b>Trump</b> Jr. at the head of his businesses claiming they would not communicate with him regarding his interests. However, critics noted that this would not prevent him from having input into his businesses and knowing how to benefit himself, and <b>Trump</b> continued to receive quarterly updates on his businesses. As his presidency progressed, he failed to take steps or show interest in further distancing himself from his business interests resulting in numerous potential conflicts. Ethics experts found Trump's plan to address conflicts of interest between his position as president and his private business interests to be entirely inadequate. Unlike every other president in the last 40 years, <b>Trump</b> did not put his business interests in a blind trust or equivalent arrangement \"to cleanly sever himself from his business interests\". In January 2018, a year into his presidency, <b>Trump</b> owned stakes in hundreds of businesses.After <b>Trump</b> took office, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, represented by a number of constitutional scholars, sued him for violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause (a constitutional provision that bars the president or any other federal official from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments), because his hotels and other businesses accept payment from foreign governments. CREW separately filed a complaint with the General Services Administration (GSA) over <b>Trump</b> International Hotel Washington, D.C.; the 2013 lease that <b>Trump</b> and the GSA signed \"explicitly forbids any elected government official from holding the lease or benefiting from it\". The GSA said it was \"reviewing the situation\". By May 2017, the CREW v. <b>Trump</b> lawsuit had grown with additional plaintiffs and alleged violations of the Domestic Emoluments Clause. In June 2017, attorneys from the Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs had no right to sue and that the described conduct was not illegal. Also in June 2017, two more lawsuits were filed based on the Foreign Emoluments Clause: D.C. and Maryland v. Trump, and Blumenthal v. Trump, which was signed by more than one-third of the voting members of Congress. United States District Judge George B. Daniels dismissed the CREW case on December 21, 2017, holding that plaintiffs lacked standing. D.C. and Maryland v. <b>Trump</b> cleared three judicial hurdles to proceed to the discovery phase during 2018, with prosecutors issuing 38 subpoenas to Trump's businesses and cabinet departments in December before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay days later at the behest of the Justice Department, pending hearings in March 2019. NBC News reported that by June 2019 representatives of 22 governments had spent money at <b>Trump</b> properties. In January 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuits as <b>Trump</b> was no longer president. === Saudi Arabia === In March 2018, The New York Times reported that George Nader had turned Trump's major fundraiser Elliott Broidy \"into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ... High on the agenda of the two men ... was pushing the White House to remove Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson,\" a top defender of the Iran nuclear deal in Donald Trump's administration, and \"backing confrontational approaches to Iran and Qatar\". === Transparency, data availability, and record keeping === The Washington Post reported in May 2017, \"a wide variety of information that until recently was provided to the public, limiting access, for instance, to disclosures about workplace violations, energy efficiency, and animal welfare abuses\" had been removed or tucked away. The Obama administration had used the publication of enforcement actions taken by federal agencies against companies as a way to name and shame companies that engaged in unethical and illegal behaviors.The <b>Trump</b> administration stopped the longstanding practice of logging visitors to the White House, making it difficult to tell who has visited the White House. In July 2018, CNN reported that the White House had suspended the practice of publishing public summaries of Trump's phone calls with world leaders, bringing an end to a common exercise from previous administrations.Trump refused to follow the rules of the Presidential Records Act, which requires presidents and their administrations to preserve all official documents and turn them over to the National Archives. <b>Trump</b> habitually tore up papers after reading them, and White House staffers were assigned to collect the scraps and tape them back together for the archives. He also took boxes of documents and other items with him when he left the White House; the National Archives later retrieved them. Some of the documents he took with him were discovered to be classified, including some at the \"top secret\" level. <b>Trump</b> sometimes used his personal cellphone to converse with world leaders so that there would be no record of the conversation. By May 2022, federal prosecutors had empaneled a grand jury to investigate possible mishandling of documents by <b>Trump</b> and other officials in his White House. === Hatch Act violations === In the first three and a half years of Trump's term, the Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal government ethics agency, found 13 senior <b>Trump</b> administration officials in violation of the Hatch Act of 1939, which restricts the government employees' involvement in politics; 11 of the complaints were filed by the activist group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). By comparison, CREW stated that it was aware of only two findings of Hatch Act violations during the eight years of the Obama administration.Henry Kerner, head of the Office of Special Counsel, found in a report released in November 2021 that at least thirteen administration officials demonstrated \"willful disregard\" for the Hatch Act, including \"especially pernicious\" behavior in the days before the 2020 election. === Security clearances === In March 2019, Tricia Newbold, a White House employee working on security clearances, privately told the House Oversight Committee that at least 25 <b>Trump</b> administration officials had been granted security clearances over the objections of career staffers. Newbold also asserted that some of these officials had previously had their applications rejected for \"disqualifying issues\", only for those rejections to be overturned with inadequate explanation.After the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed former head of White House security clearances Carl Kline to give testimony, the administration instructed Kline not to comply with the subpoena, asserting that the subpoena \"unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests\". Kline eventually gave closed-door testimony before the committee in May 2019, but House Democrats said he did not \"provide specific details to their questions\". === Impeachment inquiry === On August 12, 2019, an unnamed intelligence official privately filed a whistleblower complaint with Michael Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG), under the provisions of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA). The whistleblower alleged that <b>Trump</b> had abused his office in soliciting foreign interference to improve his own electoral chances in 2020. The complaint reports that in a July 2019 call, <b>Trump</b> had asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate potential 2020 rival presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as matters pertaining to whether Russian interference occurred in the 2016 U.S. election with regard to Democratic National Committee servers and the company Crowdstrike. <b>Trump</b> allegedly nominated his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to work with Ukraine on these matters. Additionally, the whistleblower alleged that the White House attempted to \"lock down\" the call records in a cover-up, and that the call was part of a wider pressure campaign by Giuliani and the <b>Trump</b> administration to urge Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The whistleblower posits that the pressure campaign may have included <b>Trump</b> cancelling Vice President Mike Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip, and <b>Trump</b> withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019.Inspector General Atkinson found the whistleblower's complaint both urgent and credible, so he transmitted the complaint on August 26 to Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Under the law, Maguire was supposed to forward the complaint to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees within a week. Maguire refused, so Atkinson informed the congressional committees of the existence of the complaint, but not its content. The general counsel for Maguire's office said that since the complaint was not about someone in the intelligence community, it was not an \"urgent concern\" and thus there was no need to pass it to Congress. Later testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on September 26, Maguire said he had consulted with the White House Counsel and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, of which the latter office gave him the rationale to withhold the complaint. Maguire also testified: \"I think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way.\"On September 22, <b>Trump</b> confirmed that he had discussed with Zelensky how \"we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\" <b>Trump</b> also confirmed that he had indeed temporarily withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradicting reasons for his decision on September 23 and 24. On September 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of a formal impeachment inquiry. On September 25, the White House released a non-verbatim transcript of the call between <b>Trump</b> and Zelensky; while the members and staff of congressional intelligence committees were allowed to read whistleblower complaint. On September 26, the White House declassified the whistleblower's complaint, so Schiff released the complaint to the public. The non-verbatim transcript corroborated the main allegations of the whistleblower's report about the Trump\u2013Zelensky call. The non-verbatim transcript stated that after Zelensky discussed the possibility of buying American anti-tank missiles to defend Ukraine, <b>Trump</b> instead asked for a favor, suggesting an investigation of the company Crowdstrike, while later in the call he also called for an investigation of the Bidens, and cooperation with Giuliani and Barr. On September 27, the White House confirmed the whistleblower's allegation that the <b>Trump</b> administration had stored the Trump\u2013Zelensky transcript in a highly classified system.Following these revelations, members of congress largely divided along party lines, with Democrats generally in favor of impeachment proceedings and Republicans defending the president. Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker resigned and three House committees issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to schedule depositions for Volker and four other State Department employees, and to compel the release of documents. Attention to the issue also led to further revelations by anonymous sources. These included the misuse of classification systems to hide records of conversations with Ukrainian, Russian and Saudi Arabian leaders, and statements made to Sergei Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak in May 2017 expressing disconcern about Russian interference in U.S. elections. === Use of the Office of President === <b>Trump</b> often sought to use the office of the presidency for his own interest. Under his leadership, the Justice Department, which is traditionally independent from the President, became highly partisan and acted in Trump's interest.Bloomberg News reported in October 2019 that during a 2017 Oval Office meeting, <b>Trump</b> had asked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to pressure the Justice Department to drop a criminal investigation of Reza Zarrab, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who was a client of <b>Trump</b> associate Rudy Giuliani. Tillerson reportedly refused.Trump attempted to host the 2020 G7 Summit at his Doral Golf Resort, from which he could have made significant profits. <b>Trump</b> visited his properties 274 times during his presidency. Government officials were charged as much as $650 per night to stay at Trump's properties.In the lead up to the 2020 election, <b>Trump</b> and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a close ally of Trump, sought to hamper the US postal service by cutting funding and services, a move which would prevent postal votes from being counted during the COVID-19 pandemic.Trump has fired, demoted or withdrawn numerous government officials in retaliation for actions that projected negatively on his public image, or harmed his personal or political interests, including Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey, Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.In December 2020, shortly before Christmas and in his last month in office, <b>Trump</b> granted 26 people full pardons and commuted the sentences of three others convicted of federal crimes. Those who benefitted included his former campaign advisor Paul Manafort, advisor and personal friend Roger Stone and Charles Kushner, father of Trump's son-in-law and confidant Jared Kushner. In the final hours of his presidency, Donald <b>Trump</b> pardoned nearly 74 people, including rappers, financiers, and former members of congress. Those pardoned include his former senior adviser Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner's friend charged with cyberstalking, Ken Kurson; a real estate lawyer, Albert Pirro; and rappers prosecuted on federal weapons offenses, Lil Wayne and Kodak Black. <b>Trump</b> also pardoned his former fundraiser Elliott Broidy, who worked for China, the UAE, and Russia at the White House. Broidy also lobbied the US government to end the investigations in the 1MDB scandal.According to several reports, Trump's and his family's trips in the first month of his presidency cost U.S. taxpayers nearly as much as former president Obama's travel expenses for an entire year. When Obama was president, <b>Trump</b> frequently criticized him for taking vacations which were paid for with public funds. The Washington Post reported that Trump's atypically lavish lifestyle is far more expensive to the taxpayers than what was typical of former presidents and could end up in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the whole of Trump's term.A June 2019 analysis by the Washington Post found that federal officials and GOP campaigns had spent at least $1.6 million at businesses owned by <b>Trump</b> during his presidency. This was an undercount, as most of the data on spending by government officials covered only the first few months of Trump's presidency. == Elections during the <b>Trump</b> presidency == === 2018 mid-term elections === In the 2018 mid-term elections, Democrats had a blue wave, winning control of the House of Representatives, while Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate. === 2020 re-election campaign === On June 18, 2019, <b>Trump</b> announced that he would seek re-election in the 2020 presidential election. <b>Trump</b> did not face any significant rivals for the 2020 Republican nomination, with some state Republican parties cancelling the presidential primaries in the states. Trump's Democratic opponent in the general election was former Vice President Joe Biden of Delaware. The election on November 3 was not called for either candidate for several days. On November 7, the Associated Press along with mainstream media called the race for Joe Biden.It was the first presidency since that of Herbert Hoover in 1932 in which a sitting president was defeated and his party lost its majorities in both chambers of Congress. ==== Lost re-election and transition period ==== <b>Trump</b> refused to concede, and the administration did not begin cooperating with president-elect Biden's transition team until November 23. In late December 2020, Biden and his transition team criticized <b>Trump</b> administration political appointees for hampering the transition and failing to cooperate with the Biden transition team on national security areas, such as the Defense and State departments, as well as on the economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that many of the agencies that are critical to their security have incurred enormous damage and have been hollowed out \u2013 in personnel, capacity and in morale. Throughout December and January, <b>Trump</b> continued to insist that he had won the election. He filed numerous lawsuits alleging election fraud, tried to persuade state and federal officials to overturn the results, and urged his supporters to rally on his behalf. At the urging and direction of <b>Trump</b> campaign attorneys and other <b>Trump</b> associates, including Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon, Republican activists in seven states filed and submitted false documents claiming to be the official presidential electors. The \"alternate slates\" were intended to serve as a reason for Congress or the Vice President to reject the results from the seven states. ==== U.S. Capitol attack ==== On January 6, 2021, rioters supporting <b>Trump</b> stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to thwart a joint session of Congress during which the Electoral College vote was to be certified, affirming the election of former vice president Joe Biden as president. During an initial rally earlier that morning, <b>Trump</b> encouraged his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol. Subsequently, pro-Trump attendees marched to the Capitol building, joined other protesters, and stormed the building. Congress was in session at the time, conducting the Electoral College vote count and debating the results of the vote. As the protesters arrived, Capitol security evacuated the Senate and House of Representatives chambers and locked down several other buildings on the Capitol campus. Later that evening, after the Capitol was secured, Congress went back into session to discuss the Electoral College vote, finally affirming at 3:41 a.m. that Biden had won the election.Five casualties occurred during the event: one Capitol Police officer, and four stormers or protesters at the Capitol, including one rioter shot by police inside the building. At least 138 police officers (73 Capitol Police officers, 65 Metropolitan Police Department officers) were injured, including at least 15 who were hospitalized, some with severe injuries. Three improvised explosive devices were reported to have been found: one each on Capitol grounds, at the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee offices. ==== Aftermath ==== Following the Capitol attack, several cabinet-level officials and White House staff resigned, citing the incident and Trump's behavior. On January 6, the night of the storming, a number of White House officials submitted their resignations, including Stephanie Grisham (chief of staff to the first lady), Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger, White House Social Secretary Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd, and Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Matthews. More officials continued to resign, including Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Tyler Goodspeed, and former White House chief of staff and special envoy to Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney.On January 7, the day after the Electoral College results were certified by Congress, <b>Trump</b> tweeted a video in which he stated, \"A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.\" The State Department subsequently told diplomats to affirm Biden's victory. On January 12, the House voted in favor of requesting that the vice president remove <b>Trump</b> from office per the Twenty-fifth Amendment; hours earlier, Pence had indicated that he opposed such a measure. The next day, the House voted 232\u2013197 to impeach <b>Trump</b> on a charge of \"incitement of insurrection\". Ten Republican representatives joined all Democratic representatives in voting to impeach Trump. <b>Trump</b> is the first and only president to be impeached twice. On February 13, the Senate voted 57\u201343 to convict <b>Trump</b> on a charge of inciting insurrection, ten votes short of the required two-thirds majority, and he was acquitted. Seven Republican senators joined all Democratic and independent senators in voting to convict Trump.Trump gave a farewell address the day prior to the inauguration of Joe Biden. In it he stressed his economic and foreign policy record, and said the country can never tolerate \"political violence\". Breaking from tradition, <b>Trump</b> did not attend Biden's inauguration, becoming the first departing president in 152 years to refuse to attend his elected successor's inauguration, but he did honor another tradition by leaving Biden a letter on the Resolute desk in the White House. == Historical evaluations and public opinion == In the sixth Siena College Research Institute's presidential rankings, conducted after <b>Trump</b> had been in office for one year, <b>Trump</b> was ranked as the third-worst president. C-SPAN's 2021 President Historians Survey ranked <b>Trump</b> as the fourth-worst president overall and the worst in the leadership characteristics of Moral Authority and Administrative Skills. Trump's best rated leadership characteristic was Public Persuasion, where he ranked 32nd out of the 44 individuals who were previously president.At the time of the 2016 election, polls by Gallup found <b>Trump</b> had a favorable rating around 35% and an unfavorable rating around 60%, while Clinton held a favorable rating of 40% and an unfavorable rating of 57%. 2016 was the first election cycle in modern presidential polling in which both major-party candidates were viewed so unfavorably. By January 20, 2017, Inauguration Day, Trump's approval rating average was 42%, the lowest rating average for an incoming president in the history of modern polling; during his term it was an \"incredibly stable (and also historically low)\" 36% to 40%. <b>Trump</b> was the only president to never reach a 50% approval rating in the Gallup poll dating to 1938.Since the beginning of the presidency of Donald Trump, ratings of how well U.S. democracy is functioning sharply plunged. According to the 2018 Varieties of Democracy Annual Democracy Report, there has been \"a significant democratic backsliding in the United States [since the Inauguration of Donald Trump] ... attributable to weakening constraints on the executive.\" Independent assessments by Freedom House and Bright Line Watch found a similar significant decline in overall democratic functioning. == See also == == References == Footnotes Citations == Further reading == Albrecht, Don E. \"Donald <b>Trump</b> and changing rural/urban voting patterns.\" Journal of Rural Studies 91 (2022): 148\u2013156.

Trump, a Republican from New York City, took office following his Electoral College victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, in which he lost the popular vote to Clinton by nearly three million votes. Upon his inauguration, he became the first president in American history without prior public office or military background. <b>Trump</b> made an unprecedented number of false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. His presidency ended with defeat in the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden after one term in office. <b>Trump</b> was unsuccessful in his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act but took measures to hinder its functioning and rescinded the individual mandate. <b>Trump</b> sought substantial spending cuts to major welfare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. He signed the Great American Outdoors Act, reversed numerous environmental regulations, and withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change. He signed the First Step Act on job training and early release of some federal prisoners and appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. In economic policy, he partially repealed the Dodd\u2013Frank Act and signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He enacted tariffs, triggering retaliatory tariffs from China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and signed the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement, a successor agreement to NAFTA. The federal deficit increased under <b>Trump</b> due to spending increases and tax cuts. He implemented a controversial family separation policy for migrants apprehended at the United States\u2013Mexico border. Trump's demand for the federal funding of a border wall resulted in the longest US government shutdown in history. He deployed federal law enforcement forces in response to the racial unrest in 2020. Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy was characterized by unilateral actions, disregarding traditional allies. The administration implemented a major arms sale to Saudi Arabia; denied citizens from several Muslim-majority countries entry into the United States; recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; and brokered the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and various Arab states. His administration withdrew United States troops from northern Syria, allowing Turkey to occupy the area. His administration also made a conditional deal with the Taliban to withdraw United States troops from Afghanistan in 2021. <b>Trump</b> met North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un three times. <b>Trump</b> withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement and later escalated tensions in the Persian Gulf by ordering the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani. Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation (2017\u20132019) concluded that Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and that while the prevailing evidence \"did not establish that members of the <b>Trump</b> campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government\", possible obstructions of justice occurred during the course of that investigation. <b>Trump</b> attempted to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rival Joe Biden, triggering his first impeachment by the House of Representatives on December 18, 2019, but he was acquitted by the Senate on February 5, 2020. <b>Trump</b> reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials in his messaging, and promoted misinformation about unproven treatments and the availability of testing. Following his loss in the 2020 presidential election to Biden, <b>Trump</b> refused to concede and initiated an extensive campaign to overturn the results, making false claims of widespread electoral fraud. On January 6, 2021, during a rally at the Ellipse, <b>Trump</b> urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and march to the Capitol, where the electoral votes were being counted by Congress in order to formalize Biden's victory. A mob of <b>Trump</b> supporters stormed the capitol, suspending the count and causing Vice President Mike Pence and other members of Congress to be evacuated. On January 13, the House voted to impeach <b>Trump</b> an unprecedented second time for \"incitement of insurrection\", but he was later acquitted by the Senate again on February 13, after he had already left office. <b>Trump</b> had historically low approval ratings, and scholars and historians rank his presidency as one of the worst in American history.", "Words": ["Trump"]}, {"title": "Donald Trump Jr.", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "content": "Donald John <b>Trump</b> Jr. (born December 31, 1977) is an American businessman, former television presenter, political activist, and author. He is the eldest child of Donald <b>Trump</b> and his first wife Ivana Trump. <b>Trump</b> serves as a trustee and executive vice president of The <b>Trump</b> Organization, running the company alongside his younger brother Eric. During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so. He served as a \"boardroom judge\" on the 'reality'-TV show featuring his father, The Apprentice. He authored Triggered in 2019 and Liberal Privilege in 2020. <b>Trump</b> was active in his father's 2016 presidential campaign. He cooperated with Russia in their interference in the 2016 United States elections and had a meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. <b>Trump</b> campaigned for several Republicans during the 2018 midterm elections. He has promoted several conspiracy theories.Trump was also active in his father's 2020 presidential campaign, often being on the campaign trail and being featured in the news for making unfounded claims. During the election he called for \"total war\" as the results were counted and promoted the stolen election conspiracy theory. Following his father's defeat, he engaged in attempts to overturn the results. He spoke at the rally that led to the storming of the Capitol, where he threatened Trump's opponents that \"we're coming for you.\" In January 2021, Attorney General for the District of Columbia Karl Racine said that he is looking at whether to charge Donald <b>Trump</b> Jr. with inciting the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol in the criminal investigation into the attack. CNN reported in April 2022 that two days after the election, <b>Trump</b> Jr. sent a text message to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows outlining paths to subvert the Electoral College process and ensure his father a second term. == Early life == <b>Trump</b> was born on December 31, 1977, in Manhattan, New York City, to Ivana and Donald Trump. He has two younger siblings, Ivanka and Eric. He also has two half siblings, Tiffany, from his father's marriage to Marla Maples, and Barron, from his father's current marriage to Melania Trump. Through his father, <b>Trump</b> is a grandson of Fred <b>Trump</b> and great-grandson of Elizabeth Christ Trump, who founded what became the <b>Trump</b> Organization.

The correspondence showed that WikiLeaks actively solicited the cooperation of <b>Trump</b> Jr., who was a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the <b>Trump</b> campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it appeared the <b>Trump</b> campaign would lose.

During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so. He served as a \"boardroom judge\" on the 'reality'-TV show featuring his father, The Apprentice. He authored Triggered in 2019 and Liberal Privilege in 2020. <b>Trump</b> was active in his father's 2016 presidential campaign. He cooperated with Russia in their interference in the 2016 United States elections and had a meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. <b>Trump</b> campaigned for several Republicans during the 2018 midterm elections. He has promoted several conspiracy theories.Trump was also active in his father's 2020 presidential campaign, often being on the campaign trail and being featured in the news for making unfounded claims. During the election he called for \"total war\" as the results were counted and promoted the stolen election conspiracy theory. Following his father's defeat, he engaged in attempts to overturn the results. He spoke at the rally that led to the storming of the Capitol, where he threatened Trump's opponents that \"we're coming for you.\" In January 2021, Attorney General for the District of Columbia Karl Racine said that he is looking at whether to charge Donald <b>Trump</b> Jr. with inciting the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol in the criminal investigation into the attack. CNN reported in April 2022 that two days after the election, <b>Trump</b> Jr. sent a text message to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows outlining paths to subvert the Electoral College process and ensure his father a second term.", "Words": ["Trump"]}, {"title": "Mueller special counsel investigation", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "content": "The Robert Mueller special counsel investigation was an investigation into 45th U.S. president Donald <b>Trump</b> regarding Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and was conducted by special prosecutor Robert Mueller from May 2017 to March 2019. It was also called the Russia investigation, the Mueller probe, and the Mueller investigation.The Mueller investigation primarily focused on three major points: Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections <b>Trump</b> associates and their connection to Russian officials and espionage Possible obstruction of justice by <b>Trump</b> and his associatesThe Mueller investigation culminated with the Mueller report, which concluded that the <b>Trump</b> campaign welcomed Russian interference and expected to benefit from it. Though there was insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy, members of the campaign were indicted, including national security advisor Michael Flynn and the chair of the <b>Trump</b> presidential campaign, Paul Manafort. The investigation resulted in charges against 34 individuals and 3 companies, 8 guilty pleas, and a conviction at trial. The report did not reach a conclusion about possible obstruction of justice by Trump, citing a Justice Department guideline that prohibits the federal indictment of a sitting president. However, Attorney General William Barr pointed to ten episodes of potential obstruction.The Mueller investigation was created by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Former FBI director Mueller was chosen to lead it due to a shortage of senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys. The dismissal of James Comey was a factor in the decision to use a Special Counsel. The Mueller investigation took over the FBI's investigation, which the FBI had named Crossfire Hurricane. According to its authorizing document, the investigation's scope included allegations of \"links and/or coordination\" between the Russian government and individuals associated with the <b>Trump</b> campaign. Mueller was also mandated to pursue \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\" The probe included a criminal investigation that looked into potential conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges against President <b>Trump</b> and members of his campaign or his administration.The investigation was officially concluded on March 22, 2019. The report concluded that the Russian Internet Research Agency's social media campaign supported Trump's presidential candidacy while attacking Clinton's, and Russian intelligence hacked and released damaging material from the Clinton campaign and various Democratic Party organizations. The investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the <b>Trump</b> campaign\", and determined that the <b>Trump</b> campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. However, ultimately \"the investigation did not establish that members of the <b>Trump</b> campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\". Mueller later said that the investigation's conclusion on Russian interference \"deserves the attention of every American\".On potential obstruction of justice by President Trump, the investigation \"does not conclude that the President committed a crime\", as investigators would not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel opinion. However, the investigation \"also does not exonerate\" Trump, finding both public and private actions \"by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations\". Ten episodes of potential obstruction by the president were described. The report states that Congress can decide whether <b>Trump</b> obstructed justice, and has the authority to take action against him. Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had authorized the Mueller probe, decided on March 24, 2019, that the evidence was insufficient to establish a finding that <b>Trump</b> committed obstruction of justice. Upon his resignation on May 29, 2019, Mueller stated that, \"The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.\" In July 2019, Mueller testified to Congress that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after he left office. == Original claims of Russian election involvement == The first public US government assertion of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election came in a joint statement on September 22, 2016, by Senator Dianne Feinstein and House member Adam Schiff, the top Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively. The US Intelligence Community released a similar statement fifteen days later.In January 2017, an assessment was released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, then headed by Obama appointee James Clapper, which asserted that Russian leadership had favored presidential candidate Donald <b>Trump</b> over rival candidate Hillary Clinton, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally ordered an \"influence campaign\" to harm Clinton's electoral chances and \"undermine public faith in the US democratic process\". It is alleged that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election by bolstering the candidacies of Trump, Bernie Sanders, and Jill Stein in order to increase political instability in the United States as well as to damage the Clinton presidential campaign. == Origin and powers == === Original FBI investigations === When the special counsel was appointed by Rod Rosenstein in May 2017, the special counsel took over an existing counterintelligence investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into what proved to be Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and numerous secretive links between <b>Trump</b> associates and Russian officials and spies. According to reports, Australian officials informed American officials that in May 2016, a <b>Trump</b> presidential campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, told the Australian High Commissioner to Britain, Alexander Downer, that Russian officials were in possession of politically damaging information relating to Hillary Clinton, the rival presidential candidate to <b>Trump</b> from Democratic Party. Since the FBI, in response to this information, opened an investigation into the links between <b>Trump</b> associates and Russian officials and spies on July 31, 2016, the meeting between Papadopoulos and Downer is considered to be the 'spark' that led to the Mueller investigation. In February 2018, the Nunes memo, written by staff for U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, stated that the information on Papadopoulos \"triggered the opening of\" the original FBI investigation, rather than the Steele dossier by Christopher Steele (see below) as asserted by, among others, Trump, Nunes, Fox News hosts Steve Doocy, Ed Henry, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy.The special counsel also took over an FBI investigation on whether President <b>Trump</b> had committed obstruction of justice, which began within eight days after Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. CNN reported in December 2018 that then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe started the investigation based on Comey's firing\u2014which had been recommended in writing by Rosenstein in what became known as the Comey memo\u2014and also Comey's allegation that <b>Trump</b> had asked him to stop investigating Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn. In February 2019, McCabe, since fired from the FBI, confirmed he launched the obstruction of justice investigation for those reasons, and gave additional reasons such as Trump's multiple depictions of the investigation into <b>Trump</b> associates and Russia as a \"witch hunt\", as well as <b>Trump</b> allegedly telling Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to mention the Russia probe in Rosenstein's memo to recommend firing Comey, and Trump's comments to the Russian ambassador and NBC relating Comey's firing to the Russia probe. === Appointment and original oversight === A special counsel investigation is subject to oversight by the attorney general. After questions arose regarding contacts between then-senator Jeff Sessions and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in 2016, one of the first things Sessions did after being appointed attorney general, was to recuse himself from any Justice Department investigations regarding Russian interference in the election.Once Attorney General Sessions recused, oversight of any Russia investigation into the 2016 election fell to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a <b>Trump</b> appointee. As part of his oversight, Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel in May 2017 with the mandate \"to oversee the previously-confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters\".Rosenstein has said he would recuse himself from supervision of Mueller if he himself were to become a subject in the investigation due to his role in the dismissal of Comey. If Rosenstein were to recuse himself, his duties in this matter would have been assumed by the Justice Department's third-in-command, Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio. So long as no successor fills that office, Solicitor General Noel Francisco would assume the authorities of Associate Attorney General. === Reasons for appointing a special counsel === ==== Firing of James Comey ==== The special counsel appointment on May 17, 2017, came after protests, mostly from Democrats, over President <b>Trump</b> firing the FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017. In Congress, in reaction to Comey's firing, over 130 Democratic lawmakers called for a special counsel to be appointed, over 80 Democratic lawmakers called for an independent investigation, while over 40 Republican lawmakers expressed questions or concerns. Complicating the situation, Comey arranged to leak to the press classified information, notes from an interview with the president where <b>Trump</b> asked him to end the probe into Michael Flynn. Comey would later be rebuked by the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General for this action. <b>Trump</b> fired Comey on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, although Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe claimed Rosenstein did not want to write the recommendation to fire Comey, and only did so because <b>Trump</b> ordered him to.The New York Times reported on January 11, 2019, that FBI counterintelligence grew concerned about Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign but held off opening an investigation because of uncertainty about how to proceed on such a sensitive matter. Trump's behavior during the days immediately before and after Comey's firing caused them to begin investigating whether <b>Trump</b> had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests, knowingly or unknowingly. The FBI merged that counterintelligence investigation with a criminal obstruction of justice investigation related to Comey's firing. Mueller took over that investigation upon his appointment, although it was not immediately clear if he had pursued the counterintelligence angle.The New York Times reported in August 2020 that Rosenstein curtailed a May 2017 FBI inquiry into Trump's personal and financial dealings in Russia, giving the bureau the impression that the special counsel would investigate it, though Rosenstein instructed Mueller not to. ==== Authority ==== Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in his role as Acting Attorney General for matters related to the campaign due to the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, appointed Mueller, a former Director of the FBI, to serve as Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with authority to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, including exploring any links or coordination between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government; \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\"; and any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a).As Rosenstein later informed Congress, he elected to use a Special Counsel rather than have the FBI itself oversee the investigation because he did not believe acting Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe was the right person to lead the investigation. Instead, he would appoint a Special Counsel, as had been done in the past. U.S. Attorneys serve as special counsel, but in May 2017 there were only three Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorneys serving at the time, the Senate having not yet confirmed the new president's nominees, and those three had remained as holdovers from the previous administration pending the arrival of the new attorneys. As a result, Rosenstein decided to select Robert Mueller, though he was retired, because of his reputation.As special counsel, Mueller had the power to issue subpoenas, hire staff members, request funding, and prosecute federal crimes in connection with the election interference along with other crimes he may uncover. The constitutionality of indicting a sitting president remains an unsettled legal question. === Release of findings === The Special Counsel law requires a special counsel to confidentially provide the current attorney general with a report of findings. The attorney general, in this case William Barr, is then required to provide a summary of the findings to Congress, although he has considerable discretion in how much detail he provides. The full release of the Mueller findings to Congress and the public is not assured. Should Congress be dissatisfied with the summary it is provided, it could subpoena Mueller's full report, and, if necessary, sue in federal court. Congress could also call Mueller to testify.White House attorneys expect to preview whatever findings Barr decides to provide to Congress and the public, in order to consider asserting executive privilege to withhold the release of information gleaned from internal documents and interviews with White House officials. Commentators have noted that executive privilege cannot be invoked if the purpose is to shield wrongdoing or unlawful conduct.On March 14, 2019, the House voted 420\u20130 in favor of a non-binding resolution calling for the full special counsel report to be released to Congress and the public, excluding classified or grand jury information. The same day the bill was brought before the Senate for unanimous consent, but was blocked by Senator Lindsey Graham, who said it needed a clause requiring the appointment of a special counsel to investigate allegations against the 2016 Clinton campaign. On March 15, <b>Trump</b> stated \"there should be no Mueller Report\" because \"this was an illegal & conflicted investigation.\" Five days later he stated, \"I told the House, 'If you want, let [the public] see it,'\" adding, \"that's up to the Attorney General.\" On March 25, 2019, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blocked an effort by minority leader Chuck Schumer for the Senate to take up the same resolution approved by the House eleven days earlier.The special counsel delivered its report to Attorney General Barr on March 22, 2019. Two days later, on March 24, Barr sent a four-page letter of the report to Congress, describing the conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and obstruction of justice.Barr said the report would be delivered to Congress by mid-April, with some redactions of any information that would \"potentially compromise sources and methods\" or \"unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties\". A two-volume redacted version of the full report was publicly released on April 18, 2019. A less-redacted version of the report will eventually provided to a limited number of members of Congress. == Grand juries == On August 3, 2017, Mueller empaneled a grand jury in Washington, D.C., as part of his investigation. The grand jury has the power to subpoena documents, require witnesses to testify under oath, and issue indictments for targets of criminal charges if probable cause is found. The Washingtonian grand jury is separate from an earlier Virginian grand jury investigating Michael Flynn; the Flynn case has been absorbed into Mueller's overall investigation.The grand jury has issued subpoenas to those involved in the <b>Trump</b> Tower meeting held on June 9, 2016, at <b>Trump</b> Tower, which was also the location of Trump's presidential campaign headquarters. Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-born lobbyist and former Soviet Army officer, a participant in the Donald <b>Trump</b> Jr. meeting, testified under oath for several hours on August 11, 2017. Sam Clovis, an Iowa radio talk show host who worked on Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign, testified during the week of August 23, 2017. Jason Maloni, spokesman for Paul Manafort, testified under oath for more than two hours on September 15, 2017. Maloni was employed by Manafort following the five months he served as Chairman of Trump's campaign for president in 2016, to answer questions about Manafort's involvement in Trump's campaign. Carter Page, a former foreign-policy adviser to Trump's presidential campaign George Nader, Lebanese-American businessman who unofficially advises UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, testified during the week preceding March 5, 2018.NBC News reported on August 25, 2017, that \"in recent days\" the grand jury subpoenaed witness testimony from the executives of six public relations firms, who worked with <b>Trump</b> campaign chairman Paul Manafort on lobbying efforts in Ukraine.On January 16, 2018, The New York Times reported that Steve Bannon was subpoenaed by Mueller to testify before the standing grand jury in Washington, DC. Reuters and CNN reported the next day that Bannon had struck a deal with Mueller's team to be interviewed by prosecutors instead of testifying before the grand jury. On February 15, 2018, multiple sources reported that those interviews had taken place over several days that week. TMZ reported that Kristin M. Davis, the \"Manhattan Madam\" who had previously worked for Roger Stone, was subpoenaed in June 2018. On August 10, 2018, federal judge Beryl A. Howell found Stone's former aide Andrew Miller to be in contempt of court for refusing to testify before the grand jury. Also that day, the Mueller investigation subpoenaed Randy Credico, whom Stone had described as his \"backchannel\" to Julian Assange. The Wall Street Journal reported on November 14, 2018, that Mueller's investigators are examining whether Stone engaged in witness tampering by intimidating Credico into supporting Stone's assertions.Jerome Corsi, former Washington bureau chief of Infowars, was subpoenaed to appear on September 7, 2018, before a Mueller grand jury. Corsi's attorney said he expected his client to be asked about his association with Roger Stone, who had appeared to know in advance that WikiLeaks would release damaging information about the Clinton campaign. == Legal teams == The investigation involved multiple legal teams: the attorneys that took part in the investigation (supervised by Special Counsel Robert Mueller); the team that defended President <b>Trump</b> in his personal capacity; and the team that represented the White House as an institution separate from the President. According to CNN, as of August 2018, the prosecution team included 15 attorneys, led by Mueller. The additional supporting staff brought the number over 30. There were a few reported departures from Mueller's team.The defense had two components: Emmet Flood representing the White House, and a team representing <b>Trump</b> personally, including Jay Sekulow, Andrew Ekonomou, Rudy Giuliani, the Raskin & Raskin law firm, and Joanna Hendon. Former members of the defense team include white-collar crimes expert John Dowd and Ty Cobb representing the office of the presidency.Mueller's legal team was consistently attacked as biased against President Trump, who once referred to this team as \"The 13 Angry Democrats\". According to Politifact, while 13 of the 17 team members were indeed Democrats (the rest unaffiliated to either of the two major parties), Mueller is a registered Republican, and choosing to hire or not hire career attorneys on the basis of political affiliation is contrary to both Justice Department policy and federal law. == Changes to oversight leadership == === Whitaker's succession === As the Mueller investigation progressed, <b>Trump</b> repeatedly expressed anger over Attorney General Sessions' decision to recuse. In July 2017, <b>Trump</b> said that Sessions should have informed him about Sessions' impending recusal before <b>Trump</b> even nominated him, then <b>Trump</b> would have nominated someone else for attorney general. In May 2018, <b>Trump</b> said that he wished that he had nominated someone other than Sessions for Attorney General. In August 2018, <b>Trump</b> declared that Sessions' job was safe at least until the November 2018 United States midterm elections. Sessions resigned as attorney general on November 7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections, writing that he had resigned at Trump's request. With Sessions' resignation, <b>Trump</b> appointed Matthew Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff, as Acting Attorney General on November 7, 2018. This meant that Whitaker assumed oversight of the Mueller investigation from Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.Previously in August 2017, one month prior to joining the Justice Department as Sessions' chief of staff, Whitaker wrote an opinion column for CNN titled \"Mueller's investigation of <b>Trump</b> is going too far\". He stated that Mueller's investigation is a \"lynch mob\", that it should be limited and should not probe into Trump's finances. Whitaker also argued in 2017 that the <b>Trump</b> Tower meeting was neither improper nor evidence of collusion. The New York Times reported that White House aides and other people close to <b>Trump</b> anticipated that Whitaker would \"rein in\" the investigation.Whitaker, a vocal <b>Trump</b> supporter, had publicly criticized the Mueller investigation on several occasions before joining the Justice Department in September 2017, asserting it was \"going too far\" and referring to it as a \"lynch mob\". Whitaker is also a personal friend of Sam Clovis, a former co-chair of the <b>Trump</b> campaign who has testified to Mueller's investigators and grand jury. Because of his prior statements and involvement, many Democrats and some Republicans have asserted that Whitaker's potential conflicts of interest require him to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller, although Whitaker reportedly indicated he had no intention of doing so. Justice Department ethics officials typically review conflicts of interest to recommend recusals, but their findings are not binding and are usually kept confidential. === Barr's succession === On December 7, 2018, President <b>Trump</b> declared that he would nominate William Barr for the vacant post of Attorney General. Barr was previously Attorney General under President George H. W. Bush.During his January 2019 confirmation hearings, Barr suggested the investigation's findings could be withheld from the public, as their release is not mandated by law. In June 2018, Barr had sent an unsolicited 19-page memo to deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and <b>Trump</b> attorneys arguing that the Special Counsel's approach to potential obstruction of justice by <b>Trump</b> was \"fatally misconceived\" and that, based on his knowledge, Trump's actions were within his presidential authority. In June 2017, Barr had characterized the obstruction investigation as \"asinine\" and that it was \"taking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president\". <b>Trump</b> stated in a February 2019 interview that he had not committed to releasing the Mueller report.On February 14, 2019, Barr was sworn in as attorney general after the Senate approved his appointment by a 54\u201345 vote that day, thus gaining oversight of the Mueller investigation from Whitaker. == Topics == Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein authorized Robert Mueller to investigate and prosecute \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump\", as well as \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\" and any other matters within the scope of 28 CFR 600.4 \u2013 Jurisdiction.The investigation's broad scope allowed Mueller to investigate many topics, including: Russian election interference; links between <b>Trump</b> associates and Russian officials and spies; alleged conspiracy between <b>Trump</b> campaign and Russian agents; potential obstruction of justice; financial investigations; lobbyists; <b>Trump</b> as a subject of investigation; other topics; and the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal. == Cost\u2013benefit analysis == A cost\u2013benefit analysis of the investigation shows a net benefit for the government, with far more income than expenses. By December 2018, the investigation had cost approximately $32 million but gained approximately $48 million. More than half of the cost of the investigation was for personnel compensation and benefits. The gains were accrued primarily by uncovering unpaid taxes by targets in the investigation, seizing assets, and collecting fines. == Criminal charges == The Special Counsel indicted 34 people\u2014seven U.S. nationals, 26 Russian nationals, and one Dutch national\u2014and three Russian organizations. Two additional individuals were charged as a result of referrals to other FBI offices. Charges were filed against <b>Trump</b> campaign members George Papadopoulos, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen. Charges were also filed against bank account seller Richard Pinedo, and lawyer Alex van der Zwaan as well as Paul Manafort associate Konstantin Kilimnik. Also indicted were Russia-based Internet Research Agency and related organizations and individuals directed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, and a group of Russian hackers referred to as Viktor Netyksho, et al. On March 16, 2020, the US government dropped the charges against Prigozhin-owned companies Concord Management and Consulting and Concord Catering.Following the guilty plea of Michael Cohen for lying to the Senate Intelligence Committee, ranking member Mark Warner stated the committee had made multiple criminal referrals of individuals to Mueller and continues to examine witness testimonies for other false statements. The Democrat-controlled House Intelligence Committee voted in February 2019 to refer dozens of witness testimony transcripts and thousands of other documents to Mueller's office. Committee Republicans had blocked Democrat efforts to release the documents to Mueller's office when Republicans controlled the Committee in 2018.On January 25, 2019, Roger Stone, a long time advisor to Donald Trump, was arrested by the FBI at a pre-dawn raid in Florida. The indictment filed by the Office of the Special Counsel contained 7 charges, including obstructing an official proceeding, witness tampering, and lying to congress in regard to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and his involvement with WikiLeaks. In the charging document, prosecutors alleged that, after the first Wikileaks release of hacked DNC emails in July 2016, \"a senior <b>Trump</b> Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [WikiLeaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign. Stone thereafter told the <b>Trump</b> Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by [WikiLeaks].\" The indictment also alleged that Stone had discussed Wikileaks releases with multiple senior <b>Trump</b> campaign officials. By the time of those contacts, it had been publicly reported that the DNC emails had been hacked by Russians and provided to Wikileaks. Stone was convicted of all charges in November 2019, after the conclusion of the investigation and his sentence was commuted by Trump. === Indictments === A total of thirty-four individuals and three companies were indicted by Mueller's investigators. Eight have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of felonies, including five <b>Trump</b> associates and campaign officials. None of those five convictions \"involved a conspiracy between the campaign and Russians\" and \"Mueller did not charge or suggest charges for [...] whether the <b>Trump</b> campaign worked with the Russians to influence the election\". The investigation was, however, more complex. On May 29, 2019, in a press conference, Mueller stated that \"If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime... A president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view \u2013 that too is prohibited.\"Dozens of ongoing investigations originally handled by the Special Counsel's office were forwarded to district and state prosecutors, other Department of Justice (DoJ) branches, and other federal agencies. The following (in alphabetical order) were indicted during the Mueller investigation: 13 Russians implicated in election interference: Mueller's team indicted thirteen Russian citizens, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), Concord Management and Consulting and Concord Catering with conducting social media campaigns about the U.S. elections. Twelve of the Russian defendants, who were alleged to be members of the Russian GRU cyber espionage group known as Fancy Bear, were charged in June 2018 with hacking and leaking DNC emails. The other Russian indicted, who was not a direct employee of Fancy Bear, was Russian business tycoon Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was alleged to have served as the financier for the organization. The US government dropped all charges against Concord Management and Consulting and Concord Catering in March 2020. In November 2019, Time magazine reported that it was \"unlikely that any of the Russians will ever face a trial in the United States, but the charges make it harder for them to travel overseas\". Maria Butina, who had claimed to be a Russian gun activist, was investigated by the Special Counsel investigators and then prosecuted by the National Security Law Unit. She was imprisoned for conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent after entering a guilty plea. Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer, pled guilty to making hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in violation of campaign finance laws, and was convicted for several unrelated counts of bank and tax fraud. Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who had been appointed as National Security Advisor by the incoming <b>Trump</b> administration, was dismissed from his position and later pled guilty to making false statements to FBI investigators about his conversations with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition. Rick Gates, former <b>Trump</b> Deputy Campaign Chairman, was indicted along with Paul Manafort in October 2017 on charges related to their consultation work with pro-Russian political figures in Ukraine. The charges were dropped after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States for making false statements in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Konstantin Kilimnik, Manafort's business partner in Ukraine, was indicted for witness tampering at the behest of Manafort; Kilimnik is suspected of working for Russian intelligence. Paul Manafort, former <b>Trump</b> campaign chairman was found guilty on eight felony counts of tax evasion and bank fraud, pursuant to his earlier lobbying activities for the Party of Regions of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich. He later pled guilty to conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of justice; in total, he was sentenced to over seven years in jail in February 2018. George Papadopoulos, <b>Trump</b> campaign foreign policy adviser, was convicted for making false statements to the FBI. Roger Stone, a longtime <b>Trump</b> advisor who had met with a Russian person offering to sell derogatory financial information about Hillary Clinton, was indicted on seven charges of lying to Congress and witness tampering. He pled not guilty. The jury subsequently found him guilty on all seven counts. Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer with the global law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, he pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to investigators while answering questions about Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. == Conclusions == === Report sent to Attorney General === On March 22, 2019, the special counsel's office concluded their investigation and sent a report to the Department of Justice where it was received by Attorney General William Barr. Barr, at Trump's nomination, had become attorney general on February 14, 2019, gaining oversight of the investigation from Trump-appointed Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. Whitaker had assumed oversight from Rosenstein on November 7, 2018, after the resignation of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the investigation. Both Barr and Whitaker had been critical of the Mueller investigation before their appointments. Barr has faced bipartisan pressure to release the full report to the public, to the maximum extent permissible by law.On March 24, 2019, Attorney General Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress regarding the special counsel's findings regarding Russian interference and obstruction of justice. Barr said that on the question of Russian interference in the election, Mueller detailed two ways in which Russia attempted to influence the election, firstly disinformation and social media campaigns by the Internet Research Agency to cause social discord, and secondly computer hacking and strategic release of emails from the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and Democratic Party organizations. However, Barr quoted the report as saying: \"[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the <b>Trump</b> Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"On the question of obstruction of justice, Barr said no conclusion was reached by the special counsel, noting that Mueller wrote \"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him\". Barr and Rosenstein concluded that the evidence for obstruction of justice could not form the basis for a prosecution. On April 18, Barr and Rosenstein held a press conference ninety minutes before a redacted version of the report, titled Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, was released to Congress and the public. A less-redacted version is planned to be accessible to \"a bipartisan group of leaders from several Congressional committees\". === Follow-up to Attorney General's letter === The New York Times reported on April 3, 2019, that some members of the special counsel had told associates that they believe Barr's letter did not adequately portray their findings, which they considered to be more troubling for <b>Trump</b> than reported. The next day, The Washington Post reported that members of Mueller's team, who spoke anonymously, reported that the evidence gathered on obstruction of justice was \"much more acute than Barr suggested.\" These members of Mueller's team revealed that they believed that the evidence showed <b>Trump</b> obstructed justice, but that the entire team could not draw a conclusion because they were split over the evidence and law. The Washington Post report did not explain why they believed their findings to be more serious than Barr's conclusions and it is unknown how many members of the special counsel hold these opinions.Barr's letter quoted Mueller's report as stating, \"the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\" leading Barr to write, \"the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\" and concluding, \"while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President's intent with respect to obstruction.\" Some legal analysts challenged Barr's reasoning that <b>Trump</b> would not have intended to obstruct justice solely because he knew he had not committed a crime, noting that one can have intent to obstruct justice for other reasons, such as protecting associates from harm.In May 2021, federal judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled the Barr DOJ had misled her and Congress by asserting a heavily redacted March 2019 internal memorandum contained only deliberative analysis of whether <b>Trump</b> should be charged with obstruction of justice. Jackson had seen the unredacted memo and concluded it contained \"strategic\" analysis to justify a decision Barr had already made. She ordered the memo to be publicly released within two weeks, pending any appeal by the DOJ. === Congressional requests for full report === On April 3, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee, which did not receive the unredacted report by its April 2 deadline, voted 24\u201317 along party lines to approve a resolution which authorizes subpoenas of the full report. The resolution also authorized subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trump's former top advisers, including strategist Steve Bannon, communications director Hope Hicks, chief of staff Reince Priebus, former-White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Annie Donaldson.The Justice Department discussed the report with White House attorneys, and Barr discussed it in an April 18, 2019, press conference, a few hours before its release to Congress and the public later that day.On April 19, 2019, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler issued a subpoena for the release of the full unredacted report. On May 3, 2019, Nadler informed Barr that a subpoena had been issued giving him until May 6 to release the full unredacted Mueller Report to the House Judiciary Committee. On May 6, after Barr failed to meet the committee's deadline to release the full report, the committee agreed to hold a vote to start Contempt of Congress proceedings against Barr on May 8. A law issued in 1857 gives Congress the power to issue criminal charges for this matter. Trump's announcement of executive privilege came just hours before the House Judiciary Committee planned to vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt. On May 8, 2019, after <b>Trump</b> invoked executive privilege, the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to reject White House's assertion of executive privilege and approve a motion put forward by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fl) which states that a vote to hold Barr in contempt would not \"be construed as a directive for the Attorney General to violate Federal law or rules.\" In a 24\u201316 vote, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt. === Release of redacted report === On April 18, 2019, a redacted version of the Special Counsel's report titled Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, was released to Congress and the public. About one-eighth of the lines in the public version were redacted. The report was in two volumes, the first about Russian interference in the election and potential involvement of <b>Trump</b> associates, and the second on possible obstruction of justice by Trump. ==== Russian interference ==== The report concluded that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election did occur \"in sweeping and systematic fashion\" and \"violated U.S. criminal law.\"The first method detailed in the final report was the usage of the Internet Research Agency, waging \"a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. <b>Trump</b> and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\". The Internet Research Agency also sought to \"provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States\".The second method of Russian interference saw the Russian intelligence service, the GRU, hacking into email accounts owned by volunteers and employees of the Clinton presidential campaign, including that of campaign chairman John Podesta, and also hacking into \"the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\". As a result, the GRU obtained hundreds of thousands of hacked documents, and the GRU proceeded by arranging releases of damaging hacked material via the WikiLeaks organization and also GRU's personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\"The Russians had also hacked old Republican Party domains and emails, but, according to James Comey, \"none of that was released\", and there was no sign \"that the <b>Trump</b> campaign or the current RNC was successfully hacked\". According to the ODNI assessment, the Russians did not release the content in the way they did to the Democrats. ==== Conspiracy vs collusion ==== Mueller used \"coordination\" and \"conspiracy\" in a synonymous fashion as he looked for evidence of agreed coordination, not just a mutual understanding (\"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\"). Mueller expressly explained why he was not interested in proving mere collusion, which he, for the purposes of his investigation, determined was not the same as \"conspiracy\". There had to be \"coordination\", which implies a conscious \"agreement\". To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the <b>Trump</b> campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators \"applied the framework of conspiracy law\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law\". They also investigated if members of the <b>Trump</b> campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement \u2014 tacit or express \u2014 between the <b>Trump</b> campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.The report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the <b>Trump</b> campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a <b>Trump</b> presidency\" and that the 2016 <b>Trump</b> presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. However, ultimately \"the investigation did not establish that members of the <b>Trump</b> campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\". The evidence was not necessarily complete due to encrypted, deleted, or unsaved communications as well as false, incomplete, or declined testimony. ==== Obstruction of justice ==== The second volume of the report investigated the topic of obstruction of justice, describing ten episodes where <b>Trump</b> may have obstructed justice as president and one episode before he was elected, and analyzing each in terms of the criteria needed to constitute criminal obstruction. The investigation found both public and private actions \"by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations\". However, <b>Trump</b> mostly failed to influence it because his subordinates or associates refused to carry out his instructions. The Mueller team refrained from charging <b>Trump</b> with obstruction because investigators abided by a DOJ Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion that a sitting president cannot stand trial, and they feared that charges would affect Trump's governing and possibly preempt a potential impeachment. In addition, investigators felt it would be unfair to accuse <b>Trump</b> of a crime without charges and without a trial in which he could clear his name. Since they had decided \"not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment\" on whether to \"initiate or decline a prosecution,\" the special counsel's office \"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct.\" The report \"does not conclude that the president committed a crime\", but specifically did not exonerate <b>Trump</b> on obstruction of justice, because investigators were not confident that <b>Trump</b> was innocent after examining his intent and actions. The report concluded that Congress has the authority to take further action against <b>Trump</b> on the question of obstruction of justice, stating that no one is above the law. == End of investigation == On May 29, 2019, Mueller announced that he was retiring as special counsel and that the office would be shut down, and he spoke publicly about the report for the first time. Saying \"[t]he report is my testimony,\" he indicated he would have nothing to say that wasn't already in the report. On the subject of obstruction of justice, he said he had been prohibited by Justice Department policy from charging the president with a crime and that any potential wrongdoing by a president must be addressed by a \"process other than the criminal justice system\". This suggested that the investigation could now be picked up by Congress. He stressed that the central conclusion of his investigation was \"that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American.\" He also stated: \"If we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime\".The House Judiciary and Intelligence committees subpoenaed Mueller on June 25, 2019, with a letter saying that \"the American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions.\" Mueller reluctantly agreed to testify publicly with a scheduled date of July 17. This date was later pushed back to July 24. During his testimony, Mueller answered Republican Representative Ken Buck that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after the president left office.Following the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal, the House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry against <b>Trump</b> in September 2019 but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation. == Reactions == == Investigations into origins of probes == There have been numerous calls and requests to open a counter-investigation into the origins of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane probe, with attention on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) documents against Carter Page and the Steele dossier.On April 9, 2019, Attorney General William Barr testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee. Barr announced that the Department of Justice will be \"reviewing the conduct\" of the FBI's Russia probe. \"I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016,\" Barr said. When asked whether he was suggesting that spying occurred, Barr said, \"I think that spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated, but I need to explore that.\"During Attorney General Barr's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 1, Barr again said he was looking into the origins of the FBI's Russia probe. \"Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant [referring to Stefan Halper] and a FISA warrant,\" Barr stated. \"I\u2019d like to find out whether that is in fact true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop a threat as it's being represented.\" When asked by Republican Senator John Cornyn \"Can we state with confidence that the Steele dossier was not part of the Russian disinformation campaign\" Barr responded \"No. That is one of the areas that I am reviewing. I'm concerned about it. And I don't think it's entirely speculative.\" When asked about FISA abuses by the DOJ and FBI during his testimony, Barr responded \"These are the things I need to look at, and I have to say as I said before, to the extent that there was any overreach, it was a few people in the upper echelons of the (FBI) and perhaps the department, but those people are no longer there\", Barr said.Barr appointed a federal prosecutor, John Durham, to assist in the investigation. On October 24, 2019, news media reported that Durham had opened a criminal probe into the matter, giving him the power to empanel a grand jury and to compel testimony. On December 1, 2020, the Associated Press reported that Barr had appointed Durham as a Special Counsel under the federal statute governing such appointments to conduct an investigation into \"\u2026the investigation of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III,\" by which was meant the FBI personnel who worked on Crossfire Hurricane before joining the Mueller team.On December 9, 2019, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz released a report on the FBI's use of the FISA process and related matters, concluding that no \"political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek FISA authority on Carter Page,\" but also found 17 \"significant inaccuracies and omissions\" in the FBI's four FISA applications made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain warrants for the surveillance of Page.On May 7, 2020, the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released dozens of transcripts from the Russia probe which committee chairman Adam Schiff said \"detail evidence of the <b>Trump</b> campaign's efforts to invite, make use of, and cover up Russia's help in the 2016 presidential election.\" Top officials from the Obama administration had testified that they had no empirical evidence of a conspiracy between <b>Trump</b> associates and Russian officials. == See also == Nobody Is Above the Law, a nationwide protest held on November 8, 2018 RT America, the American arm of the Russian state media network RT Russian espionage in the United States Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections Russian involvement in regime change Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, a proposed law that sought to protect the investigation Timelines related to Donald <b>Trump</b> and Russian interference in United States elections == References == == External links == Full redacted report from the Special Counsel.

Published by ABC News. Archived from the original on July 2, 2023.", "summary": "The Robert Mueller special counsel investigation was an investigation into 45th U.S. president Donald <b>Trump</b> regarding Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and was conducted by special prosecutor Robert Mueller from May 2017 to March 2019. It was also called the Russia investigation, the Mueller probe, and the Mueller investigation.The Mueller investigation primarily focused on three major points: Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections <b>Trump</b> associates and their connection to Russian officials and espionage Possible obstruction of justice by <b>Trump</b> and his associatesThe Mueller investigation culminated with the Mueller report, which concluded that the <b>Trump</b> campaign welcomed Russian interference and expected to benefit from it. Though there was insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy, members of the campaign were indicted, including national security advisor Michael Flynn and the chair of the <b>Trump</b> presidential campaign, Paul Manafort. The investigation resulted in charges against 34 individuals and 3 companies, 8 guilty pleas, and a conviction at trial. The report did not reach a conclusion about possible obstruction of justice by Trump, citing a Justice Department guideline that prohibits the federal indictment of a sitting president. However, Attorney General William Barr pointed to ten episodes of potential obstruction.The Mueller investigation was created by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Former FBI director Mueller was chosen to lead it due to a shortage of senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys. The dismissal of James Comey was a factor in the decision to use a Special Counsel. The Mueller investigation took over the FBI's investigation, which the FBI had named Crossfire Hurricane. According to its authorizing document, the investigation's scope included allegations of \"links and/or coordination\" between the Russian government and individuals associated with the <b>Trump</b> campaign. Mueller was also mandated to pursue \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\" The probe included a criminal investigation that looked into potential conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges against President <b>Trump</b> and members of his campaign or his administration.The investigation was officially concluded on March 22, 2019. The report concluded that the Russian Internet Research Agency's social media campaign supported Trump's presidential candidacy while attacking Clinton's, and Russian intelligence hacked and released damaging material from the Clinton campaign and various Democratic Party organizations. The investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the <b>Trump</b> campaign\", and determined that the <b>Trump</b> campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. However, ultimately \"the investigation did not establish that members of the <b>Trump</b> campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\". Mueller later said that the investigation's conclusion on Russian interference \"deserves the attention of every American\".On potential obstruction of justice by President Trump, the investigation \"does not conclude that the President committed a crime\", as investigators would not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel opinion. However, the investigation \"also does not exonerate\" Trump, finding both public and private actions \"by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations\". Ten episodes of potential obstruction by the president were described. The report states that Congress can decide whether <b>Trump</b> obstructed justice, and has the authority to take action against him. Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had authorized the Mueller probe, decided on March 24, 2019, that the evidence was insufficient to establish a finding that <b>Trump</b> committed obstruction of justice. Upon his resignation on May 29, 2019, Mueller stated that, \"The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.\" In July 2019, Mueller testified to Congress that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after he left office.", "Words": ["Trump"]}]
